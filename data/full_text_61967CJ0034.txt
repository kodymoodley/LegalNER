IN CASE 34/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE IVTH SENATE OF THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ), DUESSELDORF, FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  FIRMA GEBRUEDER LUECK, COLOGNE-BRAUNSFELD,  AND  HAUPTZOLLAMT ( PRINCIPAL CUSTOMS OFFICE ) KOELN-RHEINAU  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND OF THE EEC TREATY, 
Grounds
P . BY AN ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 1967, RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON OCTOBER 1967, THE FINANZGERICHT ( FINANCE COURT ), DUESSELDORF, REFERRED FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY THREE QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THAT TREATY . IT IS APPARENT FROM THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE THAT THE DISPUTE IN THE MAIN ACTION CONCERNS THE APPLICATION OF AVERAGE RATES, WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, BY A MEMBER STATE APPLYING, AT THE TIME WHEN THE DISPUTE AROSE, A TURNOVER TAX ACCORDING TO THE CUMULATIVE MULTI-STAGE TAX SYSTEM . CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE THE QUESTIONS REFERRED ONLY INVOLVE THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE INDIRECTLY THROUGH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, THE ORDER MAKING THE REFERENCE HAS NOT PUT TO THE COURT A QUESTION WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ARE CAPABLE OF CREATING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT . IN FACT, THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE HELD THAT ARTICLE IS NO MORE THAN A SPECIAL RULE CONCERNED WITH THE ADAPTATION OF ARTICLE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, DOES NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT THE RIGHTS WHICH THOSE CONCERNED MAY DERIVE FROM THE LATTER .  IN ITS JUDGMENT DELIVERED ON APRIL IN CASE 28/67, ON A REFERENCE FROM THE BUNDESFINANZHOF ( FEDERAL FINANCE COURT ), THE COURT RULED THAT ARTICLE DOES NOT CREATE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT . ACCORDINGLY IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THE FINANZGERICHT, DUESSELDORF, SHOULD BE ASKED TO REFER TO THE INTERPRETATION GIVEN IN THAT JUDGMENT, AND THAT ONLY THE FIRST AND THIRD QUESTIONS CONTAINED IN THE REFERENCE SHOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED .  P . THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS WHETHER BY THE CONCEPT OF TAXATION IMPOSED DIRECTLY ON DOMESTIC PRODUCTS ARTICLE REFERS TO THE BURDEN RESULTING FROM THE RATE FIXED BY LAW, OR THE ACTUAL BURDEN WHICH RESULTS WHEN AVERAGE EXEMPTIONS ENJOYED BY SIMILAR PRODUCTS OR GROUPS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT . THE QUESTION RELATES IN PARTICULAR TO THE EXEMPTIONS OR PAYMENTS OF DRAWBACK ON DOMESTIC PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR EXPORT, THE GRANT OF WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF LIGHTENING THE AGGREGATE BURDEN OF TAXATION ON DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS .  ARTICLE PROHIBITS THE PLACING OF PRODUCTS ORIGINATING IN OTHER MEMBER STATES IN A DISADVANTAGEOUS POSITION AS COMPARED WITH PRODUCTS FROM THE IMPORTING COUNTRY WHICH ARE MARKETED IN THE TERRITORY OF THAT COUNTRY . IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO EXCLUDE FROM THE COMPARISON ANY DOMESTIC PRODUCTION TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS EXPORTED AND DOES NOT TAKE PART IN COMPETITION WITHIN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY . THUS ONLY TAXATION AFFECTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTS MARKETED IN THE NATIONAL TERRITORY MAY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ASCERTAINING WHAT TAXATION IS IMPOSED ON DOMESTIC PRODUCTS AND CONSTITUTES THE CEILING ALLOWED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . THE TAXATION IMPOSED ON DOMESTIC PRODUCTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS THEREFORE THAT WHICH RESULTS FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE RATE OF TAX FIXED BY LAW .  THE THIRD QUESTION SEEKS A CLARIFICATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRECEDENCE OF COMMUNITY LAW, THAT IS TO SAY, IN THE PRESENT CASE, ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, WITH REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LAW INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT . THE POINT OF THE QUESTION IS IN PARTICULAR WHETHER THE NATIONAL COURT MUST HOLD SUCH PROVISIONS INAPPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH COMMUNITY LAW OR WHETHER IT MUST DECLARE THEM VOID AS FROM THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE .  ALTHOUGH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY HAS THE EFFECT OF EXCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF ANY NATIONAL MEASURE INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT, THE ARTICLE DOES NOT RESTRICT THE POWERS OF THE COMPETENT NATIONAL COURTS TO APPLY, FROM AMONG THE VARIOUS PROCEDURES AVAILABLE UNDER NATIONAL LAW, THOSE WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CONFERRED BY COMMUNITY LAW . PARTICULARLY WHEN AN INTERNAL TAX IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ONLY BEYOND A CERTAIN AMOUNT, IT IS FOR THE NATIONAL COURT TO DECIDE, ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ITS NATIONAL LAW, WHETHER THE ILLEGALITY AFFECTS THE WHOLE TAX OR ONLY SO MUCH OF IT AS EXCEEDS THAT AMOUNT . ACCORDINGLY, IT IS FOR THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE TO CHOOSE A SOLUTION FROM AMONG THOSE SUGGESTED IN THE QUESTION AND, INDEED, ANY OTHERS .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS AND BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE FINANZGERICHT, DUESSELDORF, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE FINANZGERICHT, DUESSELDORF, BY ORDER OF THAT COURT OF SEPTEMBER 1967, HEREBY RULES :  . THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 97, APPLICABLE WHERE MEMBER STATES LEVYING A TURNOVER TAX CALCULATED ON A CUMULATIVE MULTI - STAGE TAX SYSTEM IN FACT EXERCISE THE OPTION WHICH IT GIVES TO THEM, DOES NOT CREATE RIGHTS WHICH NATIONAL COURTS MUST PROTECT;  . TAXATION IMPOSED ON A DOMESTIC PRODUCT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY MEANS TAXATION IMPOSED AT THE RATE WHICH RESULTS FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW;  . ARTICLE OF THE TREATY DOES NOT RESTRICT THE POWERS OF THE COMPETENT NATIONAL COURTS TO APPLY, FROM AMONG THE VARIOUS PROCEDURES AVAILABLE UNDER NATIONAL LAW, THOSE WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CONFERRED BY COMMUNITY LAW .  THE DECISION AS TO COSTS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS IS A MATTER FOR THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE .
