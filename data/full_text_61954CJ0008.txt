Grounds
P . THE COURT  FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING JUDGMENT IN THE PRESENT CASES, PUTS FORWARD THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS IN LAW :  . ADMISSIBILITY OF APPLICATIONS 8/AND 10/A - CAPACITY OF THE APPLICANT TO RAISE THE MATTER WITH THE HIGH AUTHORITY IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY  ARTICLE ENABLES " UNDERTAKINGS OR ASSOCIATIONS " TO RAISE A MATTER WITH THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  THE ASSOCIATIONS REFERRED TO IN THIS EXPRESSION MAY ONLY BE ASSOCIATIONS OF UNDERTAKINGS WITHIN THE MEANING GIVEN TO THE WORD " UNDERTAKING " BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WHOLE TREATY .  IF IN FACT THIS WERE NOT SO, AN ASSOCIATION COULD FIND ITSELF IN A POSITION TO INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS WHERE NONE OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF WHICH IT IS FORMED COULD HAVE DONE SO ON ITS OWN .  IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY INDICATION TO THE CONTRARY, THE TREATY DOES NOT ESTABLISH SUCH DIFFERENCES IN THE TREATMENT OF AN ASSOCIATION AND THE MEMBERS OF WHICH IT IS FORMED .  P . IT IS NECESSARY TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE APPLICANT FULFILS THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITION .  THE ASSOCIATION DES UTILISATEURS DE CHARBON DU GRAND-DUCHE DE LUXEMBOURG HAS BEEN FORMED BETWEEN :  THE FEDERATION DES INDUSTRIELS LUXEMBOURGEOIS  THE GROUPEMENT DES INDUSTRIES SIDERURGIQUES LUXEMBOURGEOISES  THE GROUPEMENT DES NEGOCIANTS DE COMBUSTIBLES EN GROS  THE SOCIETE NATIONALE DES CHEMINS DE FER LUXEMBOURGEOIS AND MR LEON BRASSEUR, ENGINEER, REPRESENTING THE GAS WORKS OF THE GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG .  UNDER ARTICLE OF ITS STATUTE, ITS OBJECTS ARE :  ( A ) TO DEFEND AND REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF COAL CONSUMERS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY;  ( B ) TO GIVE OPINIONS ON QUESTIONS OF INTEREST TO COAL CONSUMERS WHICH ANY ORGAN OF THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY OR ANY OTHER AUTHORITY MAY SUBMIT TO IT .  IT IS ALSO, AS ITS TITLE EXPRESSLY INDICATES, AN ASSOCIATION OF COAL CONSUMERS .  THE FACT THAT THE GROUPEMENT DES INDUSTRIES SIDERURGIQUES LUXEMBOURGEOISES IS ONE OF ITS MEMBERS DOES NOT ALTER THIS CHARACTER AND, MOREOVER, THAT BODY HAS ALREADY LODGED ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AN APPLICATION WITH THE SAME PURPOSE .  ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE ASSOCIATION LEAVES NO DOUBT THAT ITS OBJECT IS TO DEFEND AND TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF ITS MEMBERS IN THEIR CAPACITY AS COAL CONSUMERS AND TO GIVE OPINIONS ON QUESTIONS OF INTEREST TO COAL CONSUMERS .  FOR THOSE REASONS, WITHOUT THIS FINDING PREJUDGING THE NECESSARY CAPACITY TO LODGE AN APPLICATION UNDER OTHER ARTICLES OF THE TREATY, THE ASSOCIATION DES UTILISATEURS DE CHARBON DU GRAND-DUCHE IS NOT ONE OF THE ASSOCIATIONS ENABLED TO RAISE THE MATTER WITH THE HIGH AUTHORITY IN APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE .  FOR THAT REASON, APPLICATIONS 8/AND 10/ARE INADMISSIBLE .  IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE APPLICANT MUST BE ORDERED TO BEAR THE COSTS .  
Operative part
