Grounds
P . THE HIGH AUTHORITY SUBMITS THAT BY REASON OF THE REVOCATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS THE ACTION NO LONGER HAS ANY PURPOSE .  THE APPLICANTS REPLY THAT IT IS FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE EFFECT OF THE REVOCATION BY THE DEFENDANT OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS IS THAT THE ACTION IS WITHOUT PURPOSE .  SINCE THE CONTESTED DECISIONS HAVE BEEN REVOKED THEY HAVE BECOME INAPPLICABLE .  THEREFORE, THE APPLICATIONS NOW HAVE NO PURPOSE .  CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO GROUND FOR PROCEEDING TO JUDGMENT .  
Decision on costs
THE DEFENDANT OFFERS TO PAY THE COSTS UP TO THE DATE OF REVOCATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS AND ASKS FOR THE COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE SAID REVOCATION TO BE BORNE BY THE APPLICANTS .  THE APPLICANTS ASK THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY BE ORDERED TO PAY THE WHOLE OF THE COSTS OF THE ACTION .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE WHERE A CASE DOES NOT PROCEED TO JUDGMENT THE COSTS SHALL BE IN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) THE COSTS SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE BE BORNE BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  NEVERTHELESS THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE PARTIES SINCE THE NOTIFICATION OF THE REVOCATION OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE APPLICANTS HAD DISCONTINUED THEIR APPLICATIONS AT THAT TIME .  WHEN THE APPLICANTS WERE INFORMED THAT THE CONTESTED DECISIONS HAD BEEN REVOKED THEY WERE NOT BOUND TO DISCONTINUE THEIR APPLICATIONS .  HOWEVER, FROM THAT MOMENT ONWARDS THEY NO LONGER HAD AN INTEREST IN CONTINUING THE PROCEEDINGS; IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO DISCONTINUE THEIR APPLICATIONS .  BECAUSE THEY HAD NO SUCH INTEREST, THE COSTS INCURRED AFTER THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISIONS REVOKING THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS COSTS WHICH HAVE BEEN UNREASONABLY INCURRED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND MUST THEREFORE BE BORNE BY THE APPLICANTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT  HEREBY :  . DECLARES THAT THERE IS NO GROUND FOR PROCEEDING TO JUDGMENT;  . ORDERS THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY SHALL BEAR THE COSTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE COSTS INCURRED AFTER THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISIONS REVOKING THE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS WHICH SHALL BE BORNE BY THE APPLICANTS .
