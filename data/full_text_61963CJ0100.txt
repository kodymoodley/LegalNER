IN CASE 100/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( CENTRAL COURT OF APPEAL ), BEING THE NETHERLANDS COURT OF LAST INSTANCE IN SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS, IN PURSUANCE OF AN ORDER OF THAT COURT OF OCTOBER IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE IT BETWEEN  MRS J . KALSBEEK ( NEE J . G .

Subject of the case
AND IN NINE OTHER CASES  ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATION N . OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EEC CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ( OJ OF DECEMBER 1958, PP . ET SEQ .),  
Grounds
THE COURT HAS RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR INTERPRETATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, MADE TO IT BY THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP ( CENTRAL COURT OF APPEAL ). THIS REQUEST IS IN ESSENCE DIRECTED TO FINDING WHETHER CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF A COMMUNITY REGULATION ARE APPLICABLE TO A GIVEN NETHERLANDS LAW, NAMELY, THE ' ALGEMENE WEDUWEN - EN WEZENWET ' ( AWW ) ( GENERAL WIDOWS' AND ORPHANS' INSURANCE LAW ). BY THE SAID ARTICLE THE COURT, WHEN GIVING A PRELIMINARY RULING, IS ENTITLED ONLY TO PRONOUNCE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TREATY AND OF ACTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, BUT CAN NEITHER APPLY THEM TO A PARTICULAR CASE NOR GIVE JUDGMENT BY MEANS OF THIS ARTICLE ON THE PROPRIETY OF A MEASURE OF A DOMESTIC CHARACTER . IT IS ONLY SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISO THAT THE COURT CAN ACCEPT THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO IT IN THIS CASE .  I - THE FIRST QUESTION  BY THIS QUESTION, THE CENTRAL RAAD VAN BEROEP ASKS THE COURT TO STATE WHETHER ARTICLES ( B ), ( ) ( D ) AND OF REGULATION N . ARE TO BE INTERPRETED ' AS MEANING THAT THE " LEGISLATION " REFERRED TO THEREIN ALSO INCLUDES THE " ALGEMENE WEDUWEN - EN WEZENWET ( AWW ) " ALTHOUGH THAT LAW, ADOPTED AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE REGULATION, WAS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A NOTIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) '.  ( ) IT FOLLOWS FROM THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP THAT THE AWW PROVIDES FOR INSURANCE AGAINST PREMATURE DEATH WITH BENEFITS TO SURVIVORS . IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION HAVING SUCH AN OBJECTIVE COMES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROVISIONS .  UNDER ARTICLE ( ) ( D ) OF REGULATION N . 3, SUCH REGULATION ' SHALL APPLY TO ALL LEGISLATION GOVERNING...SURVIVORS' BENEFITS OTHER THAN THOSE PAID IN RESPECT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS OR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES '. ANNEX B, ENTITLED ' LEGISLATION TO WHICH THE REGULATION APPLIES ', REFERS, UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH ( E ) OF THE SECTION RELATING TO THE NETHERLANDS, TO : ' INSURANCE AGAINST PREMATURE DEATH, INCLUDING INCREASES '. THE REGULATION MUST THEREFORE APPLY TO ALL NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR INSURANCE AGAINST PREMATURE DEATH WITH BENEFITS TO SURVIVORS .  ( ) THE APPLICATION OF REGULATION N . TO ANY LEGISLATION IS NOT PRECLUDED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LATTER CAME INTO FORCE AFTER THE SAID REGULATION AND WAS NOT NOTIFIED UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION . IN FACT, ARTICLE ( B ) OF THE REGULATION PROVIDES THAT WHEN THE REGULATION USES THE TERM ' LEGISLATION ' IT REFERS TO THE LAWS, REGULATIONS ETC . ' PRESENT AND FUTURE ' OF EACH MEMBER STATE . THIS PROVISION WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF ITS MEANING IF IT WERE PERMISSIBLE FOR ANY MEMBER STATE, BY REFRAINING FROM MAKING THE ABOVEMENTIONED NOTIFICATION, TO DECIDE FOR ITSELF THE EXTENT TO WHICH REGULATION N . SHOULD APPLY . MOREOVER, UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION, THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SUCH NOTIFICATION ONLY ARISES IN CASES IN WHICH THE ADOPTION OF NEW LEGISLATION RENDERS AN ' AMENDMENT ' TO ANNEX B NECESSARY . SUCH IS NOT THE CASE WHEN THE NEW LEGISLATION COMES UNDER ONE OF THE HEADINGS USED IN THE SAID ANNEX .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE REPLY TO THE FIRST QUESTION ASKED BY THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE .  II - THE SECOND QUESTION  THE SECOND QUESTION OF THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP IS WHETHER ' ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF THE REGULATION IS...APPLICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE WIDOW'S PENSION GRANTED UNDER THE AWW ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ' ACQUISITION, MAINTENANCE OR RECOVERY OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT ' UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE REGULATION, AND ALTHOUGH UNDER THE SYSTEM PROVIDED FOR BY THE AWW THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE DURATION OF THE INSURANCE '.  ( ) IT FOLLOWS FROM THE WORDING OF ARTICLE ( ) THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE ARE SUBJECT TO THOSE OF ARTICLE .  THE REGULATIONS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY HAVE AS THEIR BASIS, THEIR FRAMEWORK AND THEIR BOUNDS ARTICLES TO OF THE TREATY WHICH ARE AIMED AT SECURING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS . UNDER ARTICLE THESE REGULATIONS ' SECURE ' FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ' AGGREGATION, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING AND RETAINING THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT AND OF CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT, OF ALL PERIODS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES '.  THE AIM OF THIS PROVISION IS TO ALLOW THE MIGRANT WORKER TO ACQUIRE THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT BY THE AGGREGATION OF THE PERIODS OF WORK COMPLETED BY HIM IN VARIOUS MEMBER STATES . IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE TO BE CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF ALL THE PERIODS OF WORK . ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION N . ARE IN LINE WITH THIS INTENTION . THEY THUS SUPPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER, ARE BASED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AND MUST THEREFORE BE APPLIED SIMULTANEOUSLY .  IF ARTICLE WERE TO BE APPLIED SEPARATELY FROM ARTICLE 27, THE RIGHTS OF MIGRANT WORKERS MIGHT IN SOME CASES BE REDUCED . SUCH WORKERS MIGHT FIND THAT THE CALCULATIONS MADE UNDER ARTICLE RESULTED IN SMALLER BENEFITS FOR THEM THAN THE TOTAL OF THE BENEFITS TO WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGISLATION OF EACH OF THE MEMBER STATES IF THE SAID PROVISIONS HAD NOT BEEN APPLIED .  THE AIM OF ARTICLES TO OF THE TREATY WOULD NOT BE ATTAINED BUT DISREGARDED IF THE WORKER WERE OBLIGED, IN ORDER TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WHICH IS GUARANTEED TO HIM, TO FIND HIMSELF SUBJECTED TO THE LOSS OF RIGHTS ALREADY ACQUIRED IN ONE OF THE MEMBER STATES WITHOUT HAVING THEM REPLACED BY AT LEAST EQUIVALENT BENEFITS . ALTHOUGH, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ARTICLE 100, THE STATES ARE IN A POSITION, BY APPROXIMATING THEIR LAWS, TO BRING ABOUT FAIRLY RADICAL CHANGES IN THEM, SUBJECT TO THE SAFEGUARDS FOUND BOTH IN THE TREATY AND IN NATIONAL LAW, ARTICLE ON THE OTHER HAND CANNOT ALLOW THE REGULATIONS TO FALL SHORT OF THE OBJECTIVES WHICH IT SETS, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO FAVOUR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS AND WHICH WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANY REDUCTION IN THEIR RIGHTS . IT FOLLOWS FROM THESE FACTORS THEREFORE THAT ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) IS APPLICABLE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ONLY IN CASES PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE 27, THAT IS TO SAY, WHERE IT IS A QUESTION OF THE ACQUISITION, MAINTENANCE OR RECOVERY OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT .  ( ) THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP HAS NEXT RAISED THE QUESTION WHETHER ARTICLE IS APPLICABLE TO LEGISLATION WHICH DOES NOT MAKE THE AMOUNT OF THE PENSION DEPENDENT ON THE DURATION OF THE INSURANCE .  SINCE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP, REGULATION N . 130/63/EEC OF THE COUNCIL ' AMENDING CERTAIN ANNEXES TO REGULATION N . AND REGULATION N . ' ( OJ OF DECEMBER 1963, PP . ET SEQ .) HAS BEEN ADOPTED . THE PURPOSE OF THIS REGULATION IS TO MAKE GOOD THE DEFICIENCIES IN REGULATION N . . ARTICLE AMENDS ANNEX G TO THAT REGULATION RELATING TO NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION . IT PROVIDES THAT FOR THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION N . THE INSTITUTIONS ' SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ' THE NEW RULES LAID DOWN FOR THE FUTURE .  REGULATION N . IS TO BE APPLIED AS FROM ITS PUBLICATION . HOWEVER, ARTICLE ( ) PROVIDES THAT THE AMENDMENTS MADE BY THE SAID ARTICLE TO ANNEX G TO REGULATION N . COME INTO EFFECT AS FROM JANUARY . NEVERTHELESS THIS RETROACTIVE EFFECT CANNOT PREJUDICE IN ANY WAY THE PERSONS WHOSE ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFIT WAS ACQUIRED BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF REGULATION N . .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) ALSO APPLIES TO LEGISLATION WHICH DOES NOT MAKE THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT DEPENDENT ON THE DURATION OF THE INSURANCE .  ( ) HAVING REGARD TO ALL THE ABOVE, ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) IS APPLICABLE ONLY IN SO FAR AS ITS APPLICATION SECURES FOR THE PERSONS CONCERNED BENEFITS WHICH AMOUNT TO AT LEAST AS MUCH AS THOSE WHICH THEY WOULD RECEIVE BY VIRTUE OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO THEM, CONSIDERED INDEPENDENTLY OF REGULATION N . .  III - THE THIRD QUESTION  THE THIRD QUESTION, WHICH IS RAISED IF THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, IS WHETHER, ' WHERE A WIDOW'S PENSION IS GRANTED UNDER THE AWW, THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE NETHERLANDS LAW ON INVALIDITY CAN...BE CONSIDERED AS INSURANCE PERIODS FOR THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION N . '.  UNDER THE CLEAR TERMS OF SUBPARAGRAPH ( B ) OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED ARTICLE OF REGULATION N . 130, THE PERIODS IN QUESTION NOT ONLY CAN BUT MUST BE ASSIMILATED TO THE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATION ON GENERAL INSURANCE IN FAVOUR OF WIDOWS AND ORPHANS . HOWEVER, THIS INTERPRETATION IS SUBJECT TO THE CONDITION THAT SUCH ASSIMILATION MUST NOT PREJUDICE IN ANY WAY THE PERSONS WHOSE RIGHT TO BENEFIT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF REGULATION N . .  IV - THE FOURTH QUESTION  BY THIS QUESTION, THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP REQUESTS THE COURT TO STATE WHETHER ARTICLE ( ) ( G ) OF REGULATION N . 3, IN USING THE WORDS ' BENEFITS ALREADY PAID ', RELATES SOLELY TO BENEFITS ALREADY PAID ' ON JANUARY 1959, THE DATE OF THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE REGULATION '.  THE PROVISION DEALS WITH ' CASES COVERED BY SUBPARAGRAPHS ( E ) AND ( F ) OF THIS PARAGRAPH '. THE SAID SUBPARAGRAPHS ( E ) AND ( F ) INDICATE THE METHOD TO BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFIT WHERE THE PERSON CONCERNED DOES NOT ' AT A GIVEN DATE ' SATISFY THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY ALL THE LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS APPLICABLE TO HIM . SUBPARAGRAPH ( G ) PROVIDES THAT ' AS AND WHEN ' THE SAID CONDITIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY SATISFIED, THE ' BENEFITS ALREADY PAID ' SHALL BE REVIEWED . IT FOLLOWS FROM THESE PROVISIONS LOOKED AT AS A WHOLE THAT ' BENEFITS ALREADY PAID ' MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS MEANING PAYMENTS MADE IN PURSUANCE OF SUBPARAGRAPHS ( E ) AND ( F ). SUCH PAYMENTS CAN CLEARLY NOT COME ABOUT UNTIL AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATION N . 3, INCLUDING PARTICULARLY SUBPARAGRAPHS ( E ) AND ( F ) AFOREMENTIONED WHICH ARE PERMANENTLY APPLICABLE, AS IS SHOWN MOREOVER BY THE PHRASE ' AT A GIVEN DATE ' QUOTED ABOVE . THEREFORE THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ARE ALSO OF PERMANENT APPLICATION .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTIONS ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTIONS PENDING BEFORE THE CENTRALE RAAD VAN BEROEP, THE DECISION AS TO COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .
