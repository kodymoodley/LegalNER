IN CASE 19/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY BY THE SOZIALGERICHT ( SOCIAL COURT ), AUGSBURG, ( 6TH CHAMBER ) FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  GIOVANNI DE CICCO, CRAFTSMAN, RESIDING AT VILLA SANTA MARIA, PROVINCE OF CHIETI, ITALY,  AND  LANDESVERSICHERUNGSANSTALT SCHWABEN, AUGSBURG,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 1(P ), 24, ET SEQ . OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS, 
Grounds
P . BY ORDER OF AUGUST 1968, WHICH REACHED THE COURT REGISTRY ON AUGUST 1968, THE SOZIALGERICHT, AUGSBURG, BY VIRTUE OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, REFERRED TO THE COURT THE QUESTION WHETHER PERIODS OF CONTRIBUTION TO CRAFTSMEN'S INSURANCE ( SPECIAL SECTION OF THE INPS ) COMPLETED IN ITALY ARE INSURANCE PERIODS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES 1(P ), 24, ET SEQ . OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS .  IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS PROCEDURE, TO ASSESS, HAVING REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS OF COMMUNITY LAW WHICH HAVE BEEN QUOTED, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OF THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY, AS THAT TASK IS RESERVED TO THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE, WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO ENSURE THE APPLICATION OF COMMUNITY LAW TO THE DISPUTE OF WHICH IT IS SEISED .  HOWEVER, THE QUESTION THUS PUT RELATES IN SUBSTANCE TO THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO CONCERNING THE AGGREGATION OF PERIODS OF CONTRIBUTION TO A CRAFTSMEN'S INSURANCE SCHEME AND OF PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER A GENERAL SOCIAL INSURANCE SCHEME WITH A VIEW TO THE ACQUISITION OF A RIGHT TO AN INVALIDITY PENSION .  A - THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT  THE LANDESVERSICHERUNGSANSTALT SCHWABEN, THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION, DISPUTES THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT BY REASON OF AN ALLEGED WANT OF JURISDICTION ON THE PART OF THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGAL INTEREST REQUIRING PROTECTION ON THE PART OF THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION .  THESE OBJECTIONS CONCERN EXCLUSIVELY THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT MAKING THE REFERENCE AND THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACTION WHICH HAS BEEN COMMENCED BEFORE IT .  IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO APPROPRIATE TO ITSELF AN ASSESSMENT OF THESE QUESTIONS, THE SOLUTION OF WHICH IS A MATTER FOR NATIONAL COURTS .  THE COURT OF JUSTICE IS VALIDLY SEISED OF THE MATTER AND OBLIGED TO GIVE JUDGMENT WHEN A NATIONAL COURT OR TRIBUNAL ASKS IT TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY RULING ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS INDICATED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IF THAT COURT OR TRIBUNAL TAKES THE VIEW THAT A DECISION ON THAT POINT IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE IT TO GIVE JUDGMENT .  P . THE OBJECTION RAISED BY THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  B - WHETHER THE ITALIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION SHOULD BE MADE A PARTY  THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION REQUESTS THE COURT AS A SUBSIDIARY POINT TO SUMMON THE ITALIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION COMPETENT UNDER ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF REGULATION NO TO DEAL WITH THE APPLICATION FOR BENEFITS CONCERNING THE APPLICANT IN THE MAIN ACTION .  IT POINTS OUT ON THIS SUBJECT THAT A DIFFERENCE OF VIEW EXISTS BETWEEN THIS INSTITUTION, IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE RELEVANT GERMAN INSTITUTION, AND THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AS CAN BE SEEN FROM THE ATTITUDE TAKEN BY THE LATTER IN THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS .  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE STATUTE OF THE COURT, PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ONLY INVOLVE AN ENTITLEMENT FOR THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION, THE MEMBER STATES, THE COMMISSION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COUNCIL, TO SUBMIT STATEMENTS OF CASE OR WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT .  IN THE APPLICATION OF THIS PROVISION THE ITALIAN STATE HAS MADE KNOWN ITS VIEW ON THE SCOPE OF ITALIAN LAW WITH REGARD TO THE COMMUNITY RULES REFERRED TO IN THE QUESTION PUT BY THE SOZIALGERICHT, AUGSBURG .  THE COURT CANNOT AGREE TO THE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF PERSONS OR INSTITUTIONS OTHER THAN THOSE REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE OF ITS STATUTE .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE REQUEST FOR THE SUMMONING OF THE ITALIAN SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION REFERRED TO BY ARTICLES ET SEQ . OF REGULATION NO IS INADMISSIBLE .  C - THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE  ARTICLE OF THE TREATY PROVIDES FOR THE ADOPTION OF SUCH MEASURES IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY AS ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR WORKERS IN PARTICULAR BY ARRANGING FOR A SYSTEM MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SECURE FOR MIGRANT WORKERS AMONGST OTHERS ' THE AGGREGATION, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING...THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT...OF ALL PERIODS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER THE LAWS OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES '.  IN CONFORMITY WITH ARTICLE 27() OF REGULATION NO 3, WHICH IS APPLICABLE BY ANALOGY IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 24, INCLUDING ANNEX F, AND ARTICLE 26() OF THE SAME REGULATION, WHERE AN INSURED PERSON HAS BEEN SUCCESSIVELY OR ALTERNATIVELY SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF TWO OR MORE MEMBER STATES UNDER WHICH INVALIDITY BENEFITS ARE AS A RULE CALCULATED IN RELATION TO THE DURATION OF COMPLETED PERIODS, THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF EACH OF THE MEMBER STATES ARE TO BE AGGREGATED WITH A VIEW TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT .  P . IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 1(P ) OF THE SAME REGULATION THE EXPRESSION ' INSURANCE PERIODS ' COVERS CONTRIBUTION PERIODS OR PERIODS OF EMPLOYMENT AS DEFINED OR RECKONED AS INSURANCE PERIODS IN THE LEGISLATION CONCERNING A CONTRIBUTORY SCHEME UNDER WHICH THEY WERE COMPLETED .  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 1(B ) OF THE SAME REGULATION, THE EXPRESSION ' LEGISLATION ' MEANS ALL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER ENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS (' DISPOSITIONS STATUTAIRES '), PRESENT AND FUTURE OF EACH MEMBER STATE RELATING TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEMES AND BRANCHES OF SOCIAL SECURITY SET OUT IN ARTICLE 2() AND ( ) OF THE SAME REGULATION .  BY VIRTUE OF THE LATTER PROVISIONS, THE REGULATION IS APPLICABLE TO ALL SCHEMES OF SOCIAL SECURITY, GENERAL AND SPECIAL, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS, AMONGST OTHER THINGS, THE PAYMENT OF INVALIDITY BENEFITS .  ANNEX B TO THE SAME REGULATION IN ITS TURN STATES, AS IS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 3, THAT THE REGULATION APPLIES, AS FAR AS ITALY IN PARTICULAR IS CONCERNED, TO LEGISLATION RESPECTING INVALIDITY INSURANCE .  FROM ALL THESE RULES READ TOGETHER IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MATERIAL FIELD OF APPLICATION OF REGULATION NO IS DETERMINED ESSENTIALLY ACCORDING TO THAT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS REFERRED TO BY THE PROVISIONS ABOVEMENTIONED .  THE SCOPE OF REGULATION NO IS SET OUT, AS REGARDS THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES, BY ARTICLE WHICH PROVIDES THAT : ' THE PROVISIONS OF THIS REGULATION SHALL APPLY TO WAGE-EARNERS OR ASSIMILATED WORKERS WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MEMBER STATES ... '.  THIS PROVISION IS BASED ON A WIDE CONCEPTION OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES INASMUCH AS IT SUBJECTS TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE REGULATION NOT ONLY WAGE-EARNERS WITHIN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD BUT IN ADDITION ALL THOSE ASSIMILATED TO SUCH WORKERS .  IN THIS RESPECT ARTICLE FOLLOWS A GENERAL TENDENCY OF THE SOCIAL LAW OF MEMBER STATES TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY IN FAVOUR OF NEW CATEGORIES OF PERSONS BY REASON OF IDENTICAL RISKS .  HOWEVER, THE EXACT MEASURE OF THIS ASSIMILATION CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION TO WHICH THE REGULATION REFERS .  P . SUCH AN ASSIMILATION TAKES PLACE ON EVERY OCCASION ON WHICH, AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, THE PROVISIONS OF A GENERAL SCHEME OF SOCIAL SECURITY ARE EXTENDED TO A CATEGORY OF PERSONS OTHER THAN THE WAGE-EARNERS REFERRED TO BY REGULATION NO 3, WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OR METHODS OF APPLICATION EMPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE .  CRAFTSMEN MUST THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED AS ASSIMILATED TO WAGE-EARNERS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH, BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, THEY ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ONE OR MORE RISKS BY EXTENSION OF SCHEMES ORGANIZED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GENERALITY OF WORKERS .  CONSEQUENTLY CONTRIBUTION PERIODS COMPLETED IN SUCH CONDITIONS ARE CONTRIBUTION PERIODS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLES 1(P ), 24, ET SEQ . OF REGULATION NO .  THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS CANNOT BE MODIFIED BY THE EFFECT OF THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO .  GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS REGULATION HAVE THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE METHODS OF APPLICATION AND SUPPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO .  MORE PARTICULARLY, THE ITEMS SET OUT IN ANNEXES AND TO REGULATION NO HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION PUT TO THE COURT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 27() OF REGULATION NO 3, READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 2() THEREOF, THE AGGREGATION OF INSURANCE PERIODS WITH A VIEW TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT TAKES PLACE WHETHER THE SOCIAL SECURITY SCHEME BY VIRTUE OF WHICH THE PERIODS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IS REFERRED TO AS A GENERAL OR A SPECIAL SCHEME .  IN ANY EVENT THE SAID ANNEXES HAVE ONLY A DECLARATORY CHARACTER AND THE MENTION OR OMISSION OF A SCHEME OF SOCIAL SECURITY IN THOSE ANNEXES THEREFORE CANNOT MODIFY A LEGAL SITUATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS REFERRED TO BY THAT REGULATION .
