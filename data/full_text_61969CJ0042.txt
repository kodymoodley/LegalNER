Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF A MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION ON JUNE AND NOTIFIED TO MR CAFIERO BY LETTER NO OF JUNE FROM THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL FOR PERSONNEL AND ADMINISTRATION CONCERNING PAYMENT OF THE SEVERANCE GRANT TO WHICH HE IS ENTITLED UNDER ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL, 
Grounds
BY APPLICATION OF SEPTEMBER THE APPLICANT HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST THE MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION ON JUNE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THE SEVERANCE GRANT TO WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/OF THE COUNCIL .  THE ACTION IS ESSENTIALLY CONCERNED WITH OBTAINING A RULING THAT THE APPLICANT' S PECUNIARY RIGHTS, FOLLOWING THE DECISION TAKEN WITH REGARD TO HIM CONCERNING THE TERMINATION OF HIS SERVICE WITH EFFECT FROM OCTOBER 1968, MUST BE ASCERTAINED ON THE BASIS OF THE SALARY ATTACHING TO GRADE A 3, FIFTH STEP, AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE SALARY ATTACHING TO GRADE A 3, FIFTH STEP, AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE SALARY ATTACHING TO GRADE A 3, FOURTH STEP, ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICANT WAS STILL IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES DURING THE DAY OF OCTOBER .  THE APPLICANT HAS NOT CHALLENGED THE LEGALITY OF THE COMMISSION' S DECISION TERMINATING HIS SERVICE .  MOREOVER, IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, THE APPLICANT HAD ATTAINED SENIORITY CORRESPONDING TO THE FOURTH STEP IN GRADE A AS FROM OCTOBER AND THAT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMMISSION' S DECISION TERMINATING HIS SERVICE TOOK EFFECT AS FROM OCTOBER .  IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS THE APPLICANT WOULD HAVE ADVANCED TO THE FIFTH STEP IN GRADE A ON OCTOBER HAD HE STILL BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES .  THIS CASE IS THEREFORE SOLELY CONCERNED WITH THE QUESTION AT WHAT TIME THE APPLICANT' S SERVICE IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TERMINATED .  WHERE AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE, SUCH AS THAT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THIS CASE, STATES THAT IT IS TO TAKE EFFECT AS FROM A SPECIFIC DATE, THIS MEANS THAT IT BEGINS TO TAKE EFFECT ON THAT ACTUAL DAY .  ACCORDINGLY, AS FROM OCTOBER THE APPLICANT WAS NO LONGER IN THE SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITIES .  PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF ANNEX VIII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS AND ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 259/SEVERANCE GRANTS ARE TO BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE LAST BASIC SALARY OF THE OFFICIAL WHOSE SERVICE HAS BEEN TERMINATED .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE APPLICANT' S LAST BASIC SALARY WAS THAT RELATING TO THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1968, THAT IS TO SAY A SALARY ATTACHING TO GRADE A 3, FOURTH STEP .  THE APPLICANT' S PECUNIARY RIGHTS WERE THEREFORE RIGHTLY CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THIS SALARY .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE APPLICATION MUST BE REJECTED AS UNFOUNDED .  
Decision on costs
