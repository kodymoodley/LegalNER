IN CASE 12/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE BELGIAN CONSEIL D' ETAT FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  JULES GUISSART,  PLAINTIFF,  AND  BELGIAN STATE, REPRESENTED BY THE MINISTRE DE LA PREVOYANCE SOCIALE ( MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY ) ( CAISSE NATIONALE DES PENSIONS POUR EMPLOYES ),  DEFENDANT,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EEC, CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF DECEMBER 1958, P.ET SEQ .), 
Grounds
P.BY JUDGMENT OF MARCH 1967, RECEIVED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON APRIL 1967, THE BELGIAN CONSEIL D' ETAT, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DIVISION, 6TH CHAMBER, REFERRED TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF THE EEC .  THE FIRST QUESTION IN THIS REQUEST FOR INTERPRETATION IS WHETHER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ARTICLE MUST BE CONSTRUED AS CONFERRING UPON A MIGRANT WORKER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ' THE RIGHT TO ELECT EITHER THE METHOD OF CALCULATION PROVIDED BY ARTICLE OR THE METHOD OF CALCULATION RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION UNDER WHICH HE HAS COMPLETED THE INSURANCE PERIOD '.  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE TERMS OF THE THREE SUBSEQUENT QUESTIONS THAT THIS REQUEST CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR THE QUESTION WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTIONS ARE EMPOWERED : ( ) IN PURSUANCE OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 3, TO CALCULATE PRO RATA THE PENSIONS WHICH THEY GRANT BY VIRTUE OF THE LEGISLATION WHICH THEY APPLY; AND ( ) IN THE CASE OF A MIGRANT WORKER WHO DOES NOT REQUIRE AGGREGATION IN ANY MEMBER STATE IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE A RIGHT TO BENEFIT, TO DEDUCT FROM THE NOTIONAL PERIODS WITH WHICH THE LEGISLATION APPLIED BY THEM CREDITS THE PERSON CONCERNED THOSE PERIODS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN EMPLOYED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS OF OTHER PENSIONS IN OTHER MEMBER STATES .  HOWEVER, IN ITS STATEMENT OF CASE THE COMMISSION HAS PUT FORWARD THE VIEW THAT IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 11() OF THE BELGIAN LAW OF JULY AND OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF JULY - ACCORDING TO WHICH EMPLOYEES WHO ATTAIN THE AGE AT WHICH THEY ACQUIRE A RIGHT TO A PENSION BEFORE DECEMBER AND WHO CAN SHOW EVIDENCE OF YEARS' INSURANCE DURING THE YEARS PRIOR TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PENSION ARE DEEMED TO HAVE COMPLETED A FULL PERIOD OF INSURANCE OF YEARS IN BELGIUM - MR GUISSART WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LUXEMBOURG INSURANCE PERIODS TO SUPPLEMENT THE YEARS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE BELGIAN LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE MINIMUM OF YEARS REQUIRED BY THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE .  P.THIS POINT OF VIEW MUST NOT, THEREFORE, BE EXCLUDED FROM THE INTERPRETATION REQUESTED .  AS REGARDS THE FIRST QUESTION  NEITHER REGULATION NO NOR REGULATION NO PROVIDES FOR AN OPTION WITHIN THE MEANING SUGGESTED BY THE CONSEIL D' ETAT IN ITS FIRST QUESTION .  ALTHOUGH ARTICLES AND 14A OF REGULATION NO AND ARTICLES 12, 12A AND OF REGULATION NO PROVIDE FOR SUCH AN OPTION, IT IS ONLY GRANTED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF MIGRANT WORKERS, FOR EXAMPLE THOSE EMPLOYED AT DIPLOMATIC POSTS OR IN THE PERSONAL SERVICE OF OFFICIALS OF SUCH POSTS AND THE AUXILIARY STAFF OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES .  MOREOVER, THE OPTION IS RESTRICTED TO A CHOICE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATION OF THE COUNTRY OF EMPLOYMENT AND THAT OF THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN .  THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO DEPENDS THEREFORE ONLY ON THE OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE MIGRANT WORKER CONCERNED IS SITUATED .  AS REGARDS QUESTIONS 2, AND ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS ESSENTIALLY INTENDED TO COVER CASES IN WHICH THE LEGISLATION OF A MEMBER STATE DOES NOT BY ITSELF CONFER ON THE PERSON CONCERNED A RIGHT TO BENEFIT BECAUSE HE HAS NOT COMPLETED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF INSURANCE PERIODS UNDER THAT LEGISLATION .  TO THIS INTENT IT PROVIDES, FOR THE BENEFIT OF A MIGRANT WORKER WHO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY OR ALTERNATELY SUBJECT TO THE LEGISLATION OF SEVERAL MEMBER STATES, THAT THE INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF EACH OF THE MEMBER STATES SHALL BE AGGREGATED . IT FOLLOWS FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO ONLY APPLY IN CERTAIN SPECIFIC CASES AND THAT THEY HAVE NO APPLICATION IN THE CASE OF A MEMBER STATE IN WHICH THE OBJECTIVE SOUGHT BY ARTICLE IS ACHIEVED BY VIRTUE OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION ALONE . AT LEAST UNDER THOSE SYSTEMS BASED ON INSURANCE PERIODS UNDER WHICH THE AMOUNT OF A RETIREMENT PENSION VARIES IN PROPORTION SOLELY TO THE INSURANCE PERIODS WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, THESE PROVISIONS DO NOT APPLY TO A MIGRANT WORKER WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO THE AGGREGATION OF INSURANCE PERIODS IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE RIGHT TO BENEFIT IN ANY OF THE MEMBER STATES IN WHICH HE HAS COMPLETED INSURANCE PERIODS .  P.HOWEVER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEMS POSED BY THE CO-ORDINATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS PREVENTS THIS INTERPRETATION FROM BECOMING AN ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE . IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT MIGHT LEAD TO THE GRANT OF UNJUSTIFIED ADVANTAGES WHICH THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO AVOID . THIS MIGHT BE THE CASE WHERE, AS IN THIS INSTANCE, BENEFITS IN RESPECT OF INSURANCE PERIODS ACTUALLY COMPLETED IN ONE STATE ARE PAYABLE IN RELATION TO ONE SINGLE PERIOD AT THE SAME TIME AS BENEFITS IN RESPECT OF NOTIONAL PERIODS IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE . IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MUST BE PERMISSIBLE FOR A STATE WHOSE LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR NOTIONAL PERIODS IN FAVOUR OF THE INSURED PERSON TO DEDUCT FROM SUCH PERIODS THE PERIODS ACTUALLY COMPLETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE, WITHOUT ITS BEING POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THIS PROCEDURE AS CONTRARY TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . HOWEVER, IT IS FOR THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY TO WHICH THE SOCIAL SECURITY INSTITUTION IS RESPONSIBLE, AND NOT THE COMMUNITY AUTHORITY, TO DECIDE ON THIS ON THE BASIS OF ITS OWN LEGISLATION .  ON THE OTHER HAND, AS THE COMMISSION SUGGESTS, IN THE CASE OF A MIGRANT WORKER WHO HAS HAD TO AGGREGATE PERIODS COMPLETED ABROAD IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE A RIGHT TO BENEFIT, ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO APPLY .
