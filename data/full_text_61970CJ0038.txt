Summary
. THE REQUIREMENT BY THE AGRICULTURAL REGULATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY OF IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES INVOLVING FOR THE LICENSEES AN UNDERTAKING TO EFFECT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE GUARANTEE OF A DEPOSIT CONSTITUTES A METHOD WHICH IS BOTH NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE, FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE ( ) AND OF THE EEC TREATY, TO ENABLE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER THEIR INTERVENTIONS ON THE MARKET IN CEREALS .  THE SYSTEM OF LICENCES VIOLATES NO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT .  . THE LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE, WHICH IS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT OR PART OF THE DEPOSIT WHICH IS FORFEIT, IS THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE MONTH OF IMPORTATION AS STATED IN THE APPLICATION FOR THE IMPORT LICENCE .  . AN IMPLEMENTING REGULATION ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL PURSUANT TO A POWER CONTAINED IN THE BASIC REGULATION FROM WHICH IT DERIVES CANNOT DEROGATE FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THAT REGULATION .

IN CASE 38/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT ( ADMINISTRATIVE COURT ) FRANKFURT AM MAIN FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  DEUTSCHE TRADAX GMBH, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN HAMBURG,  AND  EINFUHR - UND VORRATSSTELLE FUER GETREIDE UND FUTTERMITTEL, FRANKFURT AM MAIN,  
Subject of the case
ON THE VALIDITY OF THE THIRD SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS, AND ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 183/67/EEC OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ON IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES FOR CEREALS AND CEREAL-BASED PROCESSED PRODUCTS, 
Grounds
BY ORDER OF FEBRUARY 1970, RECEIVED AT THE COURT ON JULY 1970, THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT FRANKFURT AM MAIN HAS REQUESTED THE COURT, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY, TO GIVE A PRELIMINARY RULING ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS :  ( ) IS REGULATION NO 120/OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE VALID IN SO FAR AS IN THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) IT MAKES THE ISSUE OF AN IMPORT LICENCE CONDITIONAL ON THE LODGING OF A DEPOSIT AND PROVIDES THAT THAT DEPOSIT SHALL BE FORFEITED IN WHOLE OR IN PART IF IMPORTATION IS NOT EFFECTED DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE?  ( ) IF THE ANSWER TO QUESTION ( ) IS AFFIRMATIVE : DOES THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " IN ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 183/OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE MEAN THE LEVY FIXED FOR THE FINAL MONTH OF THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE OR, AS THE DEFENDANT CONTENDS IN RELIANCE ON ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 120/67, THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE EXPECTED MONTH OF IMPORTATION SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICATION OF THE HOLDER OF THE LICENCE?  FIRST QUESTION  THE FIRST QUESTION, RELATING TO THE LEGALITY OF THE SYSTEM OF DEPOSITS INITIATED IN THE FINAL SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN CEREALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1967, P . ), IS MATERIALLY IDENTICAL TO A QUESTION REFERRED BY THE SAME COURT IN CASE 11/UPON WHICH A RULING WAS GIVEN IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF DECEMBER .  IN THAT JUDGMENT THE COURT RULED THAT EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTION PUT BY THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT REVEALED NO FACTOR CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE VALIDITY OF THE PROVISIONS AT ISSUE .  NO FRESH FACTOR CAPABLE OF ALTERING THAT JUDGMENT HAS BEEN PRODUCED DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS .  SECOND QUESTION  THE SECOND QUESTION CONCERNS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " EMPLOYED IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 183/67/EEC OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE ON IMPORT AND EXPORT LICENCES FOR CEREALS AND CEREAL-BASED PROCESSED PRODUCTS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL 1967, P . ), WHICH IS ONE OF THE FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT OR PART OF THE DEPOSIT WHICH IS FORFEITED IF IMPORTATION IS NOT EFFECTED OR IS ONLY PARTIALLY EFFECTED DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE IMPORT LICENCE .  IT APPEARS FROM THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED IN THE COURSE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS THAT THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE VARIOUS MEMBER STATES HAVE INTERPRETED THIS PROVISION IN DIFFERENT WAYS . SOME OF THEM BELIEVE THAT THE PHRASE " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PROVISION AT ISSUE MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE EXPECTED MONTH OF IMPORTATION SPECIFIED IN THE IMPORT LICENCE, WHILE OTHERS TAKE THE VIEW THAT THIS EXPRESSION MEANS THE RATE FIXED FOR THE FINAL MONTH OF THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE .  THE EINFUHR - UND VORRATSSTELLE FUER GETREIDE UND FUTTERMITTEL OF FRANKFURT AM MAIN, WHICH IS THE INTERVENTION AGENCY FOR THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY AND IS THE DEFENDANT IN THE MAIN ACTION, CONTENDS, IN RELIANCE ON ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/67, THAT THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS REFERRING TO THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE EXPECTED MONTH OF IMPORTATION . THE PLAINTIFF IN THE MAIN ACTION, ON THE OTHER HAND, TAKES THE VIEW THAT THIS EXPRESSION REFERS TO THE RATE FIXED FOR THE FINAL MONTH OF THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE . FOR A LONG TIME THE COMMISSION UPHELD THE INTERPRETATION PUT FORWARD BY THE GERMAN INTERVENTION AGENCY, BUT BEFORE THE COURT IT HAS ADOPTED THE SECOND INTERPRETATION, RELYING IN PARTICULAR ON ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 140/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE ON RULES FOR THE ADVANCE FIXING OF LEVIES ON CEREALS ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, ENGLISH SPECIAL EDITION 1967, P . ) AND ON ARGUMENTS ADDUCED FROM THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SYSTEM OF DEPOSITS .  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 183/STATES THAT THE AMOUNTS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN CALCULATING THE DEPOSIT OR PORTION OF THE DEPOSIT WHICH IS FORFEITED, IN RESPECT OF IMPORT CERTIFICATES FOR WHICH THE LEVY HAS BEEN FIXED IN ADVANCE, ARE AS FOLLOWS :  " 0.UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER METRIC TON, INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO :  - THE LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE, INCREASED BY A PREMIUM PROVIDED FOR IN THE SCALE OF PREMIUMS IN FORCE ON THE DAY OF LODGING THE REQUEST FOR THE LICENCE FOR THE MONTH OF IMPORTATION SHOWN IN THE LICENCE, OR FOR THE FINAL MONTH OF THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE, IF THE LATTER IS HIGHER; AND  - REDUCED BY THE LEVY APPLICABLE ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE IMPORT LICENCE ".  ALTHOUGH THIS PROVISION HAS TAKEN CARE TO INDICATE WITH PRECISION VARIOUS FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT OR PART DEPOSIT TO BE FORFEITED, IT HAS NOT DEFINED WHAT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE ". IN ORDER TO INTERPRET THAT EXPRESSION, REFERENCE MUST BE MADE TO THE PROVISIONS WHICH FORM THE LEGAL BASIS OF REGULATION NO 183/AS A WHOLE, NAMELY REGULATIONS NOS 120/AND 140/OF THE COUNCIL .  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/PROVIDES THAT IN A CASE OF ADVANCE FIXING THE LEVY TO BE CHARGED ON IMPORTATION IS " THE LEVY APPLICABLE ON THE DAY ON WHICH APPLICATION FOR A LICENCE IS MADE, ADJUSTED FOR THE THRESHOLD PRICE WHICH WILL BE IN FORCE DURING THE EXPECTED MONTH OF IMPORTATION ". SINCE REGULATION NO 183/USES THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " WITHOUT DEFINING IT MORE PRECISELY, IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE SAME SENSE AS THAT IN WHICH IT IS USED IN THE BASIC REGULATION NO 120/67, WHICH REGULATION NO 183/IS INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT .  CONTRARY TO THE CONTENTIONS OF THE COMMISSION, THIS LEGAL SITUATION WAS NOT ALTERED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 140/67, UNDER WHICH " IF IMPORTATION IS NOT EFFECTED DURING THE MONTH INDICATED AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION ... ( A ) THE LEVY APPLICABLE ON THE DAY ON WHICH THE APPLICATION FOR THE LICENCE WAS SUBMITTED SHALL BE ADJUSTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THRESHOLD PRICE IN FORCE ON THE DAY OF IMPORTATION ... ". IN FACT, THAT PROVISION - WHICH IS INTENDED TO MEET THE CASE IN WHICH IMPORTATION IS EFFECTED DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE BUT DURING A MONTH OTHER THAN THAT INDICATED IN THE APPLICATION FOR A LICENCE - IS NOT APPLICABLE TO A CASE IN WHICH IMPORTATION IS NOT EFFECTED, OR IS ONLY PARTIALLY EFFECTED, DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE, SO THAT THE DEPOSIT IS WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY FORFEITED . IT CANNOT BE ACCEPTED THAT THE SAID PROVISION ALTERED THE SYSTEM LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO 120/67, ESPECIALLY SINCE REGULATION NO 140/67, BEING AN IMPLEMENTING REGULATION NOT DIRECTLY BASED ON ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY BUT ON THE ENABLING PROVISION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/67, COULD NOT HAVE DEROGATED FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE BASIC REGULATION TO WHICH IT IS SUBORDINATE .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO GO INTO THE CONFLICTING ARGUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD IN THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURE REGARDING THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE DETAILED RULES FOR FIXING THE AMOUNTS TO BE WITHHELD IN CASES OF FAILURE TO IMPORT, PARTICULARLY AS THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE GIVEN RISE TO WIDELY DIVERGENT INTERPRETATIONS .  THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " IN THE FIRST INDENT OF ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 183/SHOULD THEREFORE BE INTERPRETED AS REFERRING TO THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE MONTH OF IMPORTATION SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICATION BY THE HOLDER OF THE IMPORT LICENCE .  
Decision on costs
THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS AND THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, WHICH HAVE SUBMITTED OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT, ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT, COSTS ARE A MATTER FOR THAT COURT . 
Operative part
THE COURT  IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS REFERRED TO IT BY THE VERWALTUNGSGERICHT FRANKFURT AM MAIN BY ORDER OF FEBRUARY 1970, HEREBY RULES :  ( ) EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COURT HAS REVEALED NO FACTOR CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE VALIDITY OF THE LAST SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO 120/67/EEC OF THE COUNCIL OF JUNE WHICH MAKES THE ISSUE OF IMPORT LICENCES CONDITIONAL ON THE LODGING OF A DEPOSIT GUARANTEEING THE OBLIGATION TO IMPORT DURING THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE;  ( ) THE EXPRESSION " LEVY FIXED IN ADVANCE " IN ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF REGULATION NO 183/67/EEC OF THE COMMISSION OF JUNE REFERS TO THE RATE OF LEVY FIXED FOR THE MONTH OF IMPORTATION INDICATED BY THE HOLDER OF THE IMPORT LICENCE IN HIS APPLICATION .
