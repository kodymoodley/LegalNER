Subject of the case
APPLICATION :  ( A ) ( APPLICATION 3/): FOR THE ANNULMENT OF ARTICLE 1() AND ARTICLES ( ARTICLES 7, AND ) OF DECISION NO 19/63, AND OF ARTICLE 1() AND ( ), ARTICLE 2() AND ( ) AND ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 20/63;  ( B ) ( APPLICATION 4/): FOR THE ANNULMENT OF ARTICLE 1() AND ARTICLE ( ARTICLES 7, AND ) OF DECISION NO 19/AND OF ARTICLE 1() AND ( ), ARTICLE AND ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 21/63;  
Grounds
P.I - ADMISSIBILITY  UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, UNDERTAKINGS OR ASSOCIATIONS OF UNDERTAKINGS MAY INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS FOR ANNULMENT AGAINST GENERAL DECISIONS ONLY IF THE LATTER ARE ALLEGED TO INVOLVE A MISUSE OF POWERS AFFECTING THEM .  THE CONTESTED MEASURES ESTABLISHED A LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLE, LAYING DOWN CONDITIONS FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND SETTING OUT THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM THEM; THEY ARE THEREFORE GENERAL DECISIONS .  FURTHERMORE, THIS GENERAL NATURE IS NOT DISPUTED IN THE ACTION .  CONSEQUENTLY, FOR THEIR APPLICATIONS TO BE ADMISSIBLE, THE APPLICANTS MUST CONVINCINGLY POINT TO FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATING THE PROBABILITY THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE HIGH AUTHORITY, THROUGH WANT OF FORESIGHT, OR SERIOUS LACK OF CARE AMOUNTING TO DISREGARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW, HAS PURSUED OTHER OBJECTIVES THAN THOSE FOR WHICH THE POWERS PROVIDED BY THE TREATY WERE CONFERRED UPON IT .  P.THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT FULFILLED THAT REQUIREMENT .  THE FIRST COMPLAINT MADE AGAINST THE HIGH AUTHORITY, THAT IS, OF HAVING ACTED BY MEANS OF A DECISION AND NOT BY MEANS OF A RECOMMENDATION, IS REDUCED TO A SUBMISSION OF LACK OF COMPETENCE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  THIS COMPLAINT, EVEN IF IT COULD BE JUSTIFIED, IS NOT SUCH AS TO LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY IN THIS CASE PURSUED OBJECTIVES OTHER THAN THOSE FOR WHICH THE POWERS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE WERE CONFERRED ON IT AND THAT IT THEREBY COMMITTED A MISUSE OF POWERS AGAINST THE APPLICANTS .  THE SECOND SUBMISSION CONSISTS IN ALLEGING THAT THE CONTESTED GENERAL DECISIONS INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM DISTORTING NORMAL CONDITIONS OF COMPETITION, SUBJECTING MIDDLEMEN, WHOSE ECONOMIC FUNCTION IS IDENTICAL, TO A DIFFERENT SYSTEM SOLELY ON THE FOOTING OF THEIR DIFFERING LEGAL STRUCTURE .  THIS ALLEGATION AMOUNTS TO ACCUSING THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF EMPLOYING LEGAL RATHER THAN ECONOMIC CRITERIA, WHICH, IF IT WERE TRUE, WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO CONSTITUTE A MISUSE OF POWERS .  THEREFORE THE SECOND SUBMISSION IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE MISUSE OF POWERS IN QUESTION .  FINALLY, THE THIRD PLEA BASED ON THE ALLEGATION OF A LACK OF CARE AMOUNTING TO A DISREGARD FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LAW IS BASED ON A DETAILED CRITICISM OF PUBLISHED TEXTS, WITH THE AIM OF PROVING THAT THE SAID TEXTS CONTAIN A SERIES OF UNCERTAINTIES AND OBSECURITIES WHICH COULD HARM THE APPLICANT'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITION .  HOWEVER, THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE APPLICATION OF A TEXT MIGHT BE DISCRIMINATORY OR INCOMPLETE IS INSUFFICIENT TO VITIATE IT, ABOVE ALL SINCE THE REMEDY AGAINST SUCH A POSSIBILITY LIES IN THE VIGILANCE OF THE PERSONS CONCERNED WHO, UNDER ARTICLE 33, ARE ENABLED TO CONTEST THE IMPLEMENTING MEASURES CONCERNING THEM ON ALL THE GROUNDS SET OUT IN THE SAID PROVISION .  THUS THE LAST PLEA ALSO FAILS TO ESTABLISH MISUSE OF POWERS .  IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT APPLICATIONS AND 4/MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  IN THIS CASE, SINCE THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ACTION, THEY MUST BEAR THE COSTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES APPLICATIONS 3/AND 4/AS INADMISSIBLE;  . ORDERS THE APPLICANTS TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE ACTION .
