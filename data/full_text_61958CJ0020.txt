++++APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT - DEFINITION OF A DECISION - CRITERIA APPLICABLE IN THE LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF A MEASURE BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY - EFFECT OF DECLARATION BY SERVANTS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY - DISTINCTION BETWEEN A DECISION AND AN INTERNAL OFFICE DIRECTIVE .  
Summary
( A ) THE LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF A MEASURE BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON ITS SUBJECT-MATTER AND ON ITS CONTENT .  ( B ) WHEN THE HIGH AUTHORITY SENDS A LETTER TO AN AUXILIARY AGENCY ENTRUSTED BY IT WITH THE EXECUTION OF CERTAIN PRECISE FUNCTIONS, INFORMING IT OF CERTAIN GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND IN PARTICULAR INSTRUCTING IT TO CONTINUE A CERTAIN PRACTICE FOLLOWED UP TILL THEN, THAT LETTER MAY CONSTITUTE A MERE INTERNAL OFFICE DIRECTIVE, EVEN IF IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OFFICIEL AND IF IT REFERS TO MEASURES WHICH THE AGENCY MUST TAKE IN REGARD TO UNDERTAKINGS IN THE COMMUNITY . IN ANY EVENT, THIS IS TRUE IF IT EMERGES FROM THE LETTER THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY DID NOT INTEND TO TAKE A DECISION, BUT INTENDED MERELY TO CONFIRM PRINCIPLES WHICH IT BELIEVED, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, TO BE LOGICALLY TO INFER FROM ITS PREVIOUS DECISIONS . THE FACT THAT A SERVANT OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY HAS DESCRIBED SUCH A LETTER TO A THIRD PARTY AS A " DECISION " DOES NOT INVALIDATE THE ABOVE STATEMENT ( TREATY ESTABLISHING THE ECSC, ARTICLE ).

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS CONTAINED IN THE LETTER SENT BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY ON DECEMBER TO THE OFFICE COMMUN DE CONSOMMATEURS DE FERRAILLE ( OCCF ) ( JOINT BUREAU OF FERROUS SCRAP CONSUMERS ), RELATING TO THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF " OWN RESOURCES SCRAP " WITHIN THE MEANING OF DECISIONS NOS 22/54, 14/AND 2/57, AND PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OFFICIEL NO OF FEBRUARY 1958, 
Grounds
P . ADMISSIBILITY  THE LETTER OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY DATED DECEMBER SETS OUT A GENERAL PRINCIPLE IN SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF " OWN RESOURCES " WITH REGARD TO SCRAP .  THAT LETTER WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OFFICIEL OF FEBRUARY AND THUS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL THE UNDERTAKINGS IN THE COMMUNITY .  IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A " DECISION " BY THE MARKET DIVISION, IN A LETTER DATED FEBRUARY IN ANSWER TO A FORMAL REQUEST FROM THE DEUTSCHE SCHROTTVERBRAUCHERGEMEINSCHAFT SENT TO THE HIGH AUTHORITY ON FEBRUARY .  HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO THE APPLICANT'S ARGUMENTS, THE SAID LETTER OF DECEMBER CANNOT IN LAW BE CONSIDERED AS A DECISION WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE TREATY .  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT THE SAID LETTER OF DECEMBER FOLLOWED A REQUEST FROM THE OCCF, IN THE ABSENCE OF UNANIMITY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THAT AGENCY ON THE MEANING OF THE TERM " OWN RESOURCES ", FOR THE HIGH AUTHORITY TO DEFINE THAT CONCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF DECISION NO 2/57, THE HIGH AUTHORITY REPLIED THAT THE QUESTION THUS EXPRESSED BY THE OCCF " WAS MISCONCEIVED ", IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT " FROM THE BEGINNING " THAT AGENCY " HAD BY IMPLICATION ADOPTED THE CONCEPT OF OWN RESOURCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEMANTIC VALUE OF THE EXPRESSION " AND THAT THIS CRITERION HAD TO BE MAINTAINED .  IT FOLLOWS THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY HAD NO INTENTION OF ADOPTING A DECISION, AS IT HAD BEEN FORMALLY REQUESTED TO DO, BUT MERELY TO REAFFIRM PRINCIPLES WHICH IT CONSIDERED, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, TO FOLLOW LOGICALLY FROM THE BASIC DECISION NO 2/.  P . THIS FINDING IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT AN AMENDMENT TO DECISION NO 2/WOULD HAVE REQUIRED, UNDER ARTICLE ( B ) OF THE TREATY, THE PRIOR UNANIMOUS ASSENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, A CONDITION WHICH WAS NOT FULFILLED IN THE PRESENT CASE . MOREOVER, THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY WOULD KNOWINGLY HAVE INFRINGED THIS IMPERATIVE PROVISION .  THESE CONSIDERATIONS ARE NOT INVALIDATED BY THE FACT THAT, IN ANSWER TO A FORMAL REQUEST FROM THE DEUTSCHE SCHROTTVERBRACHERGEMEINSCHAFT, SENT TO THE HIGH AUTHORITY ON FEBRUARY 1958, THE MARKET DIVISION REPLIED BY A LETTER OF FEBRUARY THAT THE LETTER OF DECEMBER WAS INDEED A " DECISION ".  IN FACT, BY ITS VERY WORDING, THIS ANSWER FROM THE MARKET DIVISION EXPRESSES THE OPINION OF AN OFFICIAL OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY, IN ITSELF ALONE AND IN THE PRESENT CASE, CONVEY THE INTENTIONS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY . IT MUST BE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THAT ANSWER COULD HAVE PROMPTED, OR EVEN DECIDED, THE APPLICANT TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THIS ALLEGED DECISION, WITH THE LEGITIMATE CONCERN OF SAFEGUARDING ITS INTERESTS .  HOWEVER, THE VARIOUS SUBJECTIVE FACTORS SET OUT ABOVE CANNOT IN THEMSELVES BE DECISIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THE LETTER OF DECEMBER IN QUESTION, SINCE THE NATURE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON ITS SUBJECT-MATTER AND ITS CONTENT .  THE SAID LETTER APPEARS AS BEING A DIRECTIVE OF AN INTERNAL CHARACTER SENT BY A SUPERIOR TO SERVICES COMING UNDER ITS AUTHORITY AND INTENDED TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE SERVICES .  THEREFORE, IF THAT LETTER COULD GIVE RISE TO IMMEDIATE DUTIES, IT COULD DO SO ONLY ON THE PART OF THE ADDRESSEE ORGANIZATION AND NOT OF UNDERTAKINGS CONSUMING FERROUS SCRAP . FURTHERMORE, THIS SITUATION IS CORROBORATED BY THE FACT THAT THAT LETTER OF DECEMBER WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OFFICIEL ONLY ON FEBRUARY .  ACCORDINGLY, THE LETTER OF DECEMBER IS NOT A DECISION WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ECSC TREATY .  CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPLICATION IS NOT ADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE ECSC, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS; IN THE PRESENT CASE THE APPLICANT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL ON THE ISSUE OF ADMISSIBILITY .  HOWEVER, SINCE, AS THE APPLICANT HAS POINTED OUT, THE DEFENDANT BY ITS LETTER OF FEBRUARY PROMPTED, OR EVEN DECIDED, THE APPLICANT TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE ALLEGED DECISION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF DECEMBER 1957, AN ORDER MUST BE MADE THAT THE PARTIES BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT  HEREBY :  DISMISSES THE APPLICATION AS INADMISSIBLE;  ORDERS THE PARTIES TO BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .
