Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE IMPLIED DECISION OF THE COUNCIL REJECTING THE COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS MADE BY THE APPLICANT ON JANUARY AND, IN SO FAR AS IS NECESSARY, OF THE EXPRESS DECISION OF THE COUNCIL OF APRIL REJECTING THE APPLICATION FOR THE LUMP SUM PAYABLE ON THE DEATH OF AN OFFICIAL PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Grounds
IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE ORDERED BY THE COURT, IT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE DEATH BY DROWNING OF THE APPLICANT' S HUSBAND WAS DUE TO INVOLUNTARY SELF-DESTRUCTION FOLLOWING MENTAL DERANGEMENT .  AS THE COURT RULES IN ITS INTERIM JUDGMENT OF JUNE 1971, THE RIGHTS OF SERVANTS AND THOSE ENTITLED UNDER THEM WITH REGARD TO RISKS OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE AND RISKS OF ACCIDENT - INCLUDING RISKS IN PRIVATE LIFE - ARE GOVERNED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INSURANCE POLICY TAKEN OUT ON JUNE BY THE DEFENDANT INSTITUTION .  IT APPEARS FROM THE STAFF REGULATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INSURANCE POLICY THAT EXCLUSION OF SUICIDE FROM COMPENSATION REFERS ONLY TO VOLUNTARY SUICIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A GENERALIZED TENDENCY IN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE MEMBER STATES BOTH WITH REGARD TO ACCIDENT INSURANCE AND SOCIAL SECURITY .  ON THE OTHER HAND, INVOLUNTARY SELF-DESTRUCTION MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE RISKS COVERED .  NEVERTHELESS THE FIRST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( D ) OF THE INSURANCE POLICY FURTHER EXCLUDES ACCIDENTS WHICH RESULT FROM MENTAL DERANGEMENT .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE EXAMINED WHETHER THIS CLAUSE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF THE PROTECTION CONFERRED BY ARTICLE ON SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES .  ARTICLE IS CONTAINED IN CHAPTER OF TITLE V OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS WHICH, AS IS SHOWN BY THE TITLE OF THE CHAPTER, CONCERNS SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS OF SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITY .  IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGAL OPINION AND CASE-LAW MOST WIDELY ADOPTED IN THE MEMBER STATES, SUCH A SYSTEM INCLUDES PROTECTION AGAINST ACCIDENTS AT WORK WHICH ARE CAUSED BY THE MENTAL DERANGEMENT OF THE PERSON CONCERNED .  CONSEQUENTLY THE EXCLUSION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( D ) OF THE POLICY IS NOT IN CONFORMITY WITH ARTICLE IN SO FAR AS IT MAY BE UPHELD AGAINST AGENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED AN ACCIDENT AT WORK .  WITH REGARD TO ACCIDENTS IN PRIVATE LIFE THE POSITION IS DIFFERENT .  A SPECIFIC PROTECTION AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACCIDENTS IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE LEGAL POSITION OF CIVIL SERVANTS .  MOREOVER, IN NO MEMBER STATE DO THE RULES GOVERNING PUBLIC SERVANTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS COVERING THIS .  FURTHERMORE, ARTICLE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE TWO RISKS BY PROVIDING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION FOR THOSE RISKS IN PRIVATE LIFE .  THEREFORE, IN ACCEPTING AN EXCLUSION CLAUSE IN THIS RESPECT THE DEFENDANT HAS NOT ACTED CONTRARY TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICATION MUST THEREFORE BE DISMISSED .  
Decision on costs
ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  NEVERTHELESS, ARTICLE OF THOSE RULES PROVIDES THAT THE COSTS INCURRED BY INSTITUTIONS IN ACTIONS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SHALL BE BORNE BY THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES .  MOREOVER, ACCOUNT MUST BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT THE ACTION WAS CAUSED BY THE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY ARISING FROM THE CONTINUING ABSENCE OF THE IMPLEMENTING RULES UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IT THEREFORE APPEARS EQUITABLE TO APPLY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND TO ORDER THE DEFENDANT TO BEAR ALL THE COSTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER )  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES THE APPLICATION;  . ORDERS THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES TO PAY THE COSTS .
