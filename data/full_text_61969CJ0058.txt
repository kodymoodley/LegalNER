Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE PARTIAL ANNULMENT AND THE RECTIFICATION OF THE PERIODIC REPORT OF MAY CONCERNING THE APPLICANT, 
Grounds
ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION  THE DEFENDANT MAINTAINS THAT THE APPLICATION, WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE COURT REGISTRY ON OCTOBER 1969, WAS FILED OUT OF TIME BECAUSE THE PERIOD STARTED TO RUN WITH THE COMMUNICATION TO THE APPLICANT ON MAY OF THE PERIODIC REPORT OF MAY .  THE APPLICANT REPLIES THAT THE PERIOD FOR LODGING THE APPLICATION BEGAN TO RUN ON THE DATE, OF THE JUDGMENT GIVEN BY THE COURT ( FIRST CHAMBER ) ON FEBRUARY IN CASE 15/68, AS THAT JUDGMENT CONSTITUTED A FRESH FACTOR WITH REGARD TO HIM .  THAT JUDGMENT DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE AN APPLICATION BROUGHT BY THE SAME APPLICANT ON JULY AGAINST A PERIODIC REPORT OF JANUARY 1968, ON THE GROUND THAT THE COMMISSION HAD REPLACED THAT MEASURE BY AN AMENDED REPORT ON MAY .  THAT JUDGMENT MERELY STATED THE SITUATION WHICH EXISTED WHEN THE FIRST APPLICATION WAS LODGED, BY DECLARING THAT THE AMENDED REPORT COULD BE USED AGAINST THE APPLICANT .  THEREFORE THE JUDGMENT OF FEBRUARY CANNOT CONSTITUTE A FACTOR WHICH COULD START RUNNING IN THE APPLICANT' S FAVOUR A NEW PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPLICATION AGAINST THE REPORT OF MAY .  AS THIS REPORT HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICANT ON MAY 1968, THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS AVAILABLE TO HIM UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS HAD ALREADY EXPIRED BEFORE THIS APPEAL WAS LODGED .  THE MEMORANDUM OF JULY WHEREBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION SIMPLY CONFIRMED THE PERIODIC REPORT IN QUESTION FOLLOWING A COMPLAINT BY THE APPLICANT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS CANNOT CONSTITUTE A MEASURE AGAINST WHICH AN APPLICATION CAN BE MADE .  THEREFORE THIS APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .
