Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR :  ( A ) THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION CONTAINING THE PROMOTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1964, DATED OCTOBER 1964, PUBLISHED BY BEING POSTED UP ON OCTOBER 1964;  ( B ) THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY 1965, NOTIFIED BY LETTER OF FEBRUARY 1965, REJECTING THE APPLICANT'S APPEAL THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS OF DECEMBER AGAINST THE DECISION CONTAINING THE PROMOTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1964;  
Grounds
P.I - ADMISSIBILITY  THE DEFENDANT ALLEGES THAT THE APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS CONCERNING PROMOTION FROM GRADE ATO GRADE ANOTIFIED BY BEING POSTED UP ON OCTOBER 1964, AND THE DECISION REJECTING THE APPEAL THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS, NOTIFIED ON FEBRUARY 1965, ARE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT OF TIME . APPLICATION 31/WAS NOT IN FACT LODGED UNTIL MAY WHILST WHEREAS THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS FOR LODGING AN APPEAL PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS, EXTENDED BY TWO DAYS ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE, EXPIRED ON MAY .  THE APPLICANT REPLIES THAT THE EXTENSION ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE APPLICABLE IN THIS CASE WAS TEN DAYS, NOT TWO, SO THAT THE PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPEAL DID NOT EXPIRE UNTIL THE EVENING OF MAY 1965, MAY BEING A HOLIDAY . IN SUPPORT OF THIS INTERPRETATION HE FIRST CLAIMS, AS HE HAS ALREADY EXPLAINED IN CASE 28/65, THAT BECAUSE HE WAS BEING KEPT ON IN THE POST TO WHICH HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS, HE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS RESIDENT AS ISPRA AND AS MERELY ON TEMPORARY MISSION TO BRUSSELS . HE GOES ON TO SAY, BASING HIS ARGUMENT ON ARTICLES AND OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THAT IN CALCULATING THE EXTENSION OF TIME ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE THE COUNTRY TO BE REFERRED TO IS NOT THE ONE WHERE THE APPLICANT HAPPENS TO BE, BUT THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LAWYER ASSISTING HIM IS RESIDENT AND PRACTISING .  IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT ON FEBRUARY 1965, THE DATE FROM WHICH THE PERIOD ALLOWED FOR LODGING AN APPEAL BEGINS TO RUN, AND FOR THE WHOLE OF THAT TIME THE APPLICANT WAS IN FACT WORKING IN BRUSSELS AND NOT AT ISPRA .  CONSEQUENTLY, ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF THE DECISION ON THE EXTENSION OF TIME-LIMITS ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE COMPRISING ANNEX II TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE APPLICANT WAS HABITUALLY RESIDENT IN BELGIUM BOTH ON FEBRUARY AND DURING THE SUBSEQUENT MONTHS AND COULD NOT, THEREFORE, ENJOY MORE THAN TWO DAYS' EXTENSION ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE . MOREOVER THE RESULT OF THE EXPRESS WORDING IN THE SAID ANNEX II : ' PARTIES...HABITUALLY RESIDENT ' IS THAT WHAT IS TO BE CONSIDERED HERE IS THE HABITUAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE OF THE PARTIES, NOT OF THEIR LAWYERS .  THE APPEAL THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS, LODGED WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR AN APPEAL TO THE COURT, HAS PRESERVED THE TIME-LIMIT UNDER THE STAFF REGULATIONS FOR MAKING AN APPEAL TO THE COURT . THE EXTENSION ON ACCOUNT OF DISTANCE IS DEPENDENT SOLELY ON THE FACTS, THAT IS TO SAY, ON WHERE THE APPLICANT HAS HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE . ACCORDINGLY THE APPLICANT, BEING HABITUALLY RESIDENT IN BELGIUM, HAD THREE MONTHS AND TWO DAYS WITHIN WHICH TO BRING AN APPEAL TO THE COURT . SINCE THIS PERIOD EXPIRED ON MAY 1965, THE APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT LODGED ON MAY ARE INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT OF TIME .  
Decision on costs

HOWEVER, ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE PROVIDES THAT IN ACTIONS BROUGHT BY COMMUNITY OFFICIALS COSTS INCURRED BY INSTITUTIONS SHALL BE BORNE BY THE LATTER .  
Operative part
