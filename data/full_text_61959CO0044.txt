Grounds
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE APPLICANT IS IN A VERY SERIOUS FINANCIAL POSITION AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A CORRESPONDING NEED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE;  IN ITS JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASES 43/59, 45/AND 48/59, THE COURT ORDERED THE DEFENDANT TO PAY TO THE APPLICANTS DAMAGES OF FB ON GROUNDS WHICH, AS THE DEFENDANT EXPRESSLY ACCEPTS, ARE AT LEAST AS VALID IN THE CASE OF THE APPLIANT, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE LATTER CAN REASONABLY EXPECT TO RECEIVE COMPARABLE DAMAGES .  EVEN IF IN THE MAIN ACTION THE COURT ANNULLED THE DISCHARGE OF THE APPLICANT, IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE NO QUESTION OF ORDERING THE DEFENDANT TO PAY DAMAGES, THE COMMISSION WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PAY TO THE APPLICANT EMOLUMENTS WHICH HE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE RECEIVED AND THE TOTAL OF HIS EMOLUMENTS WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY IN EXCESS OF THE SUM FB .  IT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE PRESENT FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE APPLICANT REQUIRES PAYMENT OF THE WHOLE OF THE DAMAGES CLAIMED AND THE PRESIENT REGARDS DAMAGES OF FB AS ENOUGH TO COVER THE APPLICANT'S IMMEDIATE NEEDS .  P . IN CONSEQUENCE, THE PRESIDENT UPHOLDS THE APPLICATION TO THE EXTENT OF FB .  THERE HAS NOT BEEN ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT ANY REQUEST THAT THE APPLICANT SHOULD LODGE ANY SECURITY OR PROVIDE A GUARANTOR AND, SUBJECT TO THE RESERVATIONS INDICATED ABOVE, IT IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE GRANT OF THE APPLICATION;  
Operative part
. THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY SHALL MAKE TO THE APPLICANT AN INTERIM PAYMENT OF FB 000;  . COSTS ARE RESERVED .
