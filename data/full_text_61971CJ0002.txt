Summary
IT IS CLEAR FROM ARTICLES AND OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION OF JANUARY THAT THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS DETERMINING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES AND NOTIFICATION THEREOF TO SUCH STATES MUST BE EFFECTED WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD, SO THAT THOSE MEASURES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS FINAL DECISIONS AND NOT AS PROVISIONAL STATEMENTS OF POSITION .  ONE AND THE SAME STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION, WHICH HAS BEEN NOTIFIED TO ALL THE MEMBER STATES, CANNOT BE REGARDED AS PROVISIONAL WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THOSE STATES .  SINCE THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED TO BRING AN ACTION WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS IT MAY NOT REPAIR THIS OMISSION BY INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A SUBSEQUENT LETTER REFUSING TO RECONSIDER THE MEASURES IN QUESTION .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF A DECISION OF REJECTION OF THE COMMISSION OF NOVEMBER AND OF THE STATEMENT OF THE ACCOUNTS OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ON WHICH THAT DECISION IS BASED, 
Grounds
ON JANUARY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY LODGED AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF REJECTION OF THE COMMISSION OF NOVEMBER TOGETHER WITH THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS FOR THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND FOR THE YEAR ON WHICH THE DECISION IS BASED .  UNDER THE FINANCIAL REGULATION RELATING TO THE METHODS AND PROCEDURE WHEREBY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MEMBER STATES SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE ( ) AND ( ) OF THE TREATY AND TO THE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS FOR CONDUCTING THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND ADOPTED ON JANUARY ( JO NO 1961, P . ), THE COMMISSION, BY LETTERS OF AND MARCH 1970, COMMUNICATED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR AND NOTIFIED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF THE SUMS TO BE PAID TO IT . BY LETTER OF MARCH 1970, THE FEDERAL MINISTER OF FINANCE RAISED OBJECTIONS TO THOSE MEASURES, BUT THE COMMISSION BY A LETTER OF NOVEMBER DISMISSED THE OBJECTIONS AND MAINTAINED ITS DECISIONS .  SINCE THE DEFENDANT CONSIDERED THAT THE LETTER OF NOVEMBER MERELY CONSTITUTED A REFUSAL TO GO BACK ON A PRIOR DECISION ESTABLISHING THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR WHICH WAS NOTIFIED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY LETTERS OF AND MARCH, IT PLEADED THAT THE APPLICATION WAS MADE OUT OF TIME .  THE APPLICANT REPLIES THAT AS LONG AS THE COMMISSION HAD NOT STATED ITS ATTITUDE TO THE OBJECTIONS SET OUT IN THE LETTER FROM THE FEDERAL MINISTER OF FINANCE OF MARCH THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS AND THE NOTIFICATIONS RELATING THERETO COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS FINAL . FURTHERMORE THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE COMMISSION GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT ITSELF CONSIDERED ITS DECISIONS IN THIS MATTER AS PROVISIONAL .  WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS AND THE NOTIFICATIONS THEREOF, THE FINANCIAL REGULATION OF JANUARY PROVIDES IN ARTICLE THAT : " ON DECEMBER OF EACH YEAR THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE : ( A ) THE BALANCES OF THE ACCOUNTS SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE OF THIS REGULATION, ( B ) THE AMOUNTS OF THE TRANSFERS TO BE MADE IN ORDER TO LIQUIDATE THE CREDIT OR DEBIT BALANCES . "  ARTICLE OF THAT REGULATION PROVIDES THAT : " AS SOON AS THE OPERATIONS SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE OF THIS REGULATION HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND IN ANY CASE NOT LATER THAN JANUARY NEXT, THE COMMISSION SHALL NOTIFY : ( A ) EACH DEBTOR MEMBER STATE OF THE AMOUNT PAYABLE BY IT TO THE COMMISSION; ( B ) EACH CREDITOR MEMBER STATE OF THE AMOUNT PAYABLE IN ITS FAVOUR BY ORDER OF THE COMMISSION . "  IT IS CLEAR FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THAT BOTH THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS AND THE NOTIFICATIONS TO MEMBER STATES MUST BE EFFECTED WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD WHICH HAS MOREOVER BEEN EXCEEDED IN THIS CASE . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MEASURES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS FINAL DECISIONS AND NOT AS PROVISIONAL STATEMENTS OF POSITION .  IN ADDITION, THE NATURE OF THE MEASURES IN QUESTION PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING CONSIDERED AS PROVISIONAL . IN FACT THE OPERATIONS RELATING TO THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND ARE COMPLEX AND CONCERN ALL THE MEMBER STATES IN THE SAME WAY, SINCE THE DECISIONS AND FINDINGS MADE REGARDING ONE MEMBER STATE AUTOMATICALLY AFFECT THE BALANCES OF THE OTHERS . ONE AND THE SAME STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS WHICH HAS BEEN NOTIFIED TO ALL THE MEMBER STATES THUS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS A PROVISIONAL STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THOSE STATES .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOREGOING THAT THE LETTERS OF THE COMMISSION OF AND MARCH CONSTITUTED FINAL MEASURES WHICH WERE CAPABLE OF BEING CONTESTED UNDER ARTICLE . SINCE THE APPLICANT FAILED TO BRING AN ACTION WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS, IT MAY NOT REPAIR THIS OMISSION BY INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A SUBSEQUENT LETTER REFUSING TO RECONSIDER THE MEASURES IN QUESTION .  CONSEQUENTLY, THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
