Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF REGULATION NO OF THE EEC ON IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF REGULATION NO CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS, 
Grounds
BY A DECISION OF JUNE THE COMMISSION DE RECLAMATION DE LIEGE EN MATIERE D' ASSURANCE OBLIGATOIRE CONTRE LA MALADIE ET L' INVALIDITE REFERRED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, THE FOLLOWING QUESTION : " ARE THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO APPLICABLE TO A WORKER SUBJECT TO TYPE A LEGISLATION IN ONE MEMBER STATE, WHO ACQUIRES IN THAT STATE ( IN THE PRESENT CASE, BELGIUM ) THE RIGHT TO SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE BENEFITS BY RELYING ON INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 3, AND WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMES AN INVALID BEFORE COMPLETING SIX MONTHS' WORK IN THE STATE WHERE HE IS SUBJECT TO TYPE A LEGISLATION, IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT NO BENEFITS CAN BE GRANTED BY THE OTHER MEMBER STATE ( IN THIS CASE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ) FOR LACK OF SUFFICIENT INSURANCE PERIODS? "  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO PROVIDES :  " IF THE INSURANCE PERIODS AND ASSIMILATED PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE DO NOT TOGETHER TOTAL SIX MONTHS NO BENEFIT SHALL BE GRANTED UNDER THE SAID LEGISLATION; IN THAT CASE, THE ABOVEMENTIONED PERIODS SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION, MAINTENANCE AND RECOVERY OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES, BUT NOT FOR DETERMINING THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE ( ) ( B ) OF THE REGULATION ( NO CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS ) ... ".  REGULATION NO PROVIDES IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS IN RESPECT OF REGULATION NO CONCERNING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR MIGRANT WORKERS .  ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE HEADING OF CHAPTER IN WHICH IT APPEARS, ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO IS CONCERNED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES TO OF REGULATION NO WHICH WERE ISSUED IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  IT IS THEREFORE IN THIS CONTEXT AND TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPLES CONTAINED IN THESE PROVISIONS THAT ARTICLE ( ) MUST BE INTERPRETED .  APART FROM THE INSTANCE GIVEN IN ARTICLE 25, ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO EXTENDS TO INCAPACITATED MIGRANT WORKERS THE BENEFIT OF AGGREGATION OF INSURANCE PERIODS AND ASSIMILATED PERIODS PROVIDED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND BY ARTICLES AND OF THE SAID REGULATION FOR THE ACQUISITION, MAINTENANCE OR RECOVERY OF PENSIONS FOR OLD-AGE AND DEATH .  ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO LAYS DOWN THE DETAILED RULES OF APPLICATION OF ARTICLES TO OF REGULATION NO IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IN WHICH THE INSURANCE PERIODS AND ASSIMILATED PERIODS, COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF ONE MEMBER STATE, DO NOT TOGETHER TOTAL SIX MONTHS .  THE AIM OF THE PROVISION IS, BY PREVENTING THE INSTITUTIONS PAYING THE BENEFITS FROM HAVING TO INCUR EXPENSES OF CALCULATION AND TRANSMISSION GREATER THAN THE BENEFITS THEMSELVES, TO SIMPLIFY THE APPLICATION OF THE AGGREGATION MECHANISM IN PARTICULAR IN VIEW OF THE VERY SMALL PROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF THOSE PERIODS .  NEVERTHELESS IN ORDER NOT TO DEPRIVE MIGRANT WORKERS OF THE ADVANTAGES OF AGGREGATION, ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO PROVIDES THAT THESE SAME PERIODS SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION, MAINTENANCE AND RECOVERY OF THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES .  ALTHOUGH, MOREOVER, THE OBJECT OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO IS TO SIMPLIFY ADMINISTRATION, THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE, NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WITHIN THE CONTEXT AND LIMITS OF THE OBLIGATION TO UNDERTAKE AN AGGREGATION IMPOSED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY AND IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT ADVERSELY THE RIGHTS STEMMING FROM THAT ARTICLE IN FAVOUR OF INDIVIDUALS .  THEREFORE IN CASES IN WHICH A PERIOD OF LESS THAN SIX MONTHS CANNOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY ANOTHER MEMBER STATE FOR LACK OF SUFFICIENT INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED UNDER THE LEGISLATION OF THAT STATE, AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO IS LACKING .  IN THIS CASE THE CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION BY THE MIGRANT WORKER OF THE RIGHT TO OLD-AGE, DEATH AND INVALIDITY BENEFITS ARE SOLELY GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES TO OF REGULATION NO .  THEREFORE THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF REGULATION NO ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO A WORKER SUBJECT TO TYPE A LEGISLATION IN ONE MEMBER STATE WHO ACQUIRES IN THAT STATE ( IN THE PRESENT CASE, BELGIUM ) THE RIGHT TO SICKNESS AND INVALIDITY INSURANCE BENEFITS BY RELYING ON INSURANCE PERIODS COMPLETED IN ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND OF REGULATION NO 3, AND WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOMES INCAPACITATED BEFORE COMPLETING SIX MONTHS' WORK IN THE STATE IN WHICH HE IS SUBJECT TO TYPE A LEGISLATION, WHEN NO BENEFITS CAN BE GRANTED BY THE OTHER MEMBER STATE ( IN THIS CASE THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY ) FOR LACK OF SUFFICIENT INSURANCE PERIODS .
