Subject of the case
CONCERNING THE REQUEST MADE UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF MARCH 1953, OR UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF MARCH 1959, BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY, THE DEFENDANT, WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION BROUGHT AGAINST IT BY THE KNUTANGE UNDERTAKING AND REQUESTING THAT THE SAID APPLICATION BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE . 
Grounds
P . BY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE REGISTRY ON MARCH 1959, THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKING, WHICH IS A PRODUCER OF STEEL, HAS CLAIMED THAT THE COURT SHOULD 'ANNUL, AS BASED ON PROVISIONS OF GENERAL DECISION N . 2/OF FEBRUARY 1957, WHICH ARE VOID, THE DECISION OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT BY LETTER OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY DATED FEBRUARY '.  ON APRIL THE DEFENDANT LODGED A PLEADING DATED APRIL . IT ARGUES THAT THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE LETTER OF FEBRUARY WAS 'TO INFORM THE UNDERTAKING CONCERNED OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH HAD BEEN REACHED UPON THE PRELIMINARY INQUIRIES INTO THE CASE, WHILE THE HIGH AUTHORITY AS SUCH HAD NOT YET TAKEN A DECISION ON THE REQUEST FOR EXONERATION MADE BY THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKING '.  THE DEFENDANT, TAKING THE VIEW THAT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE APPLICATION WAS NOT ADMISSIBLE, CLAIMED THAT THE COURT SHOULD : 'IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF MARCH OR OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF MARCH 1959, DISMISS THE APPLICATION MADE ON MARCH AS INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST A DECISION OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY '.  IN ADDITION, ON APRIL THE HIGH AUTHORITY TOOK A DECISION FORMALLY REJECTING THE REQUEST MADE BY THE KNUTANGE UNDERTAKING .  THAT DECISION WAS NOTIFIED TO THE KNUTANGE UNDERTAKING ON MAY .  AS AGAINST THE SAID DECISION THE SAID UNDERTAKING MADE A NEW APPLICATION WHICH WAS LODGED AT THE REGISTRY ON MAY . THAT APPLICATION RAISES SUBMISSIONS WHICH ARE PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE SUBMISSIONS ALREADY RAISED IN SUPPORT OF THE APPLICATION OF MARCH .  THE COURT WILL, IN ANY EVENT, BE REQUIRED TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE LEGALITY OF ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE CONTESTED DECISIONS, WHICH HAVE THE SAME CONTENTS .  THEREFORE IT IS NOT NECESSARY, AT THE PRESENT STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS, TO DECIDE WHETHER THE WRITTEN COMMUNICATION OF FEBRUARY DID OR DID NOT CONTAIN A DECISION OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  THEREFORE, FOR THE ABOVEMENTIONED REASONS, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RESERVE A DECISION ON THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION RAISED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY FOR THE FINAL JUDGMENT .  
Operative part
THE COURT  HEREBY ORDERS :  . A DECISION ON THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION RAISED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY IS RESERVED FOR THE FINAL JUDGMENT;  . THE COSTS ARE RESERVED .
