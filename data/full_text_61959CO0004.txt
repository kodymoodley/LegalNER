Grounds
P . ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF MARCH PROVIDES THAT :  'WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION OF JUDGMENTS, THE COURT MAY, OF ITS OWN MOTION OR ON APPLICATION BY A PARTY, WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS, RECTIFY CLERICAL MISTAKES, ERRORS IN CALCULATION, AND SIMILAR OBVIOUS INACCURACIES .'  P . THESE PROVISIONS CAN BE APPLIED TO THE FIRST PART OF THE APPLICATION; INDEED, IT WAS STATED IN THE JUDGMENT THAT THE EQUALIZATION AMOUNTS WERE PAID BY THE JOINT BUREAU ONLY AS THE RESULT OF AN OBVIOUS MATERIAL MISTAKE, WHEREAS IT IS EVIDENT, AND MOREOVER NOT DISPUTED BY THE PARTIES, THAT THE SUMS WERE PAID BY THE FUND .  THE JUDGMENT MUST THEREFORE BE RECTIFIED IN THAT PARTICULAR .  THE SECOND PART OF THE APPLICATION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT THE EXPRESSION 'ORGAN' INCORRECTLY REPRODUCES THE COURT'S THINKING ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE HIGH AUTHORITY AND THE JOINT BUREAU . APPARENTLY, THE APPLICANT HAS REACHED THIS CONCLUSION BECAUSE IT INTERPRETS THE WORD 'ORGAN' AS MEANING THAT THE JOINT BUREAU IS IN ALL RESPECTS AN ORGAN OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY, AS MUCH IN ITS ORGANIZATION AS IN ITS POWERS .  ON THIS POINT, THE APPLICATION CONSTITUTES IN ACTUAL FACT AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN AN INTERPRETATION OF THE GROUNDS OF THE JUDGMENT . SUCH AN INTERPRETATION WOULD GO FAR BEYOND THE CONDITIONS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF MARCH .  THIS PART OF THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .

THE ORIGINAL OF THIS ORDER SHALL BE ANNEXED TO THE ORIGINAL OF THE RECTIFIED JUDGMENT; NOTE OF IT SHALL BE MADE IN THE MARGIN OF THE ORIGINAL .
