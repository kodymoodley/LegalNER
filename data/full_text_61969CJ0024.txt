Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF :  ( A ) THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF MAY APPOINTING THE APPLICANT TO A POST IN GRADE A 5, IN SO FAR AS IT LAYS DOWN MAY AS THE DATE ON WHICH IT IS TO TAKE EFFECT;  ( B ) THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES OF MARCH REJECTING THE APPLICANT' S COMPLAINT BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  
Grounds
THE APPLICATION, REGISTERED AT THE COURT ON JUNE 1969, IS FIRST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF MAY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH, IN FIXING MAY AS THE DATE ON WHICH THE PROMOTION OF THE APPLICANT TO GRADE A TAKES EFFECT, THIS DECISION REFUSES HIM THE BENEFIT OF RETROACTIVE TREATMENT AS FROM NOVEMBER 1964, TO WHICH HE CLAIMS TO BE ENTITLED .  SECONDLY, THE APPLICATION IS FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION OF MARCH REJECTING THE APPLICANT' S CLAIM OF AUGUST UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICANT WHO CLAIMED ACTUALLY TO HAVE PERFORMED HIS DUTIES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1964, IN THE GRADE A POST TO WHICH HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPOINTED, SOUGHT BY HIS COMPLAINT TO OBTAIN A MODIFICATION OF THE DECISION OF MAY WITH A VIEW TO ITS TAKING EFFECT AS FROM NOVEMBER 1964, A DATE ON WHICH HE SATISFIED THE MINIMUM SENIORITY IN GRADE A REQUIRED FOR PROMOTION .  HIS REQUEST WAS FURTHER FOR THE GRANT FOR THE PERIOD FROM MAY UNTIL THE DATE WHEN HIS APPOINTMENT TOOK EFFECT, OF THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENTIAL ALLOWANCE PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE ( ) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE DEFENDANT NOTIFIED HIM ON AUGUST THAT " A DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THE MATTER WAS CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN " AND THAT A REPLY WOULD BE GIVEN AS SOON AS " A DEFINITE CONCLUSION " HAD BEEN REACHED .  AFTER A REMINDER ADDRESSED TO IT ON OCTOBER 1968, THE COMMISSION REJECTED THE COMPLAINT AND THE APPLICANT' S REQUEST ON MARCH 1969, THAT IS TO SAY AFTER MORE THAN THREE YEARS .  BY REASON OF THE PERIODS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE APPEAL MUST NOT BE REGARDED AS OUT OF TIME .  UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS, FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO GIVE A DECISION IN REPLY TO A REQUEST OR COMPLAINT MUST AT THE EXPIRATION OF A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS BE REGARDED AS AN IMPLIED DECISION REJECTING THE REQUEST OR COMPLAINT AND SUCH DECISION MAY BE CONTESTED WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS .  THE TWO COMBINED PERIODS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS THE LEGAL CERTAINTY INDISPENSABLE TO THEIR PROPER FUNCTIONING .  THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INTER ALIA THE FACT THAT IN AN ADMINISTRATION DECISIONS RELATING TO THE SITUATION OF A PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE STAFF MAY FREQUENTLY AFFECT THE POSITION OF OTHER OFFICIALS . IT IS NOT THEREFORE FOR THE PARTIES MOST IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED TO PROLONG THESE PERIODS AT THEIR PLEASURE .  THE LETTER OF AUGUST DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DECISION IN REPLY TO THE APPLICANT' S COMPLAINT . IT CANNOT MOREOVER, OF ITSELF, HAVE ANY OTHER LEGAL EFFECT SINCE IT HAS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INTIMATING THE CARRYING OUT BY THE COMMISSION OF AN OBLIGATION ALREADY PROVIDED FOR, AS IN ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  IT FOLLOWS THAT IF AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS THE EXAMINATION OF WHICH THE APPLICANT HAD BEEN INFORMED HAD NOT LED TO AN EXPRESS DECISION, THE COMPLAINT MUST BE REGARDED AS REJECTED BY IMPLICATION .  THE APPEAL MUST ACCORDINGLY BE CONSIDERED AS OUT OF TIME AND THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE DECISION OF MAY AND AGAINST THE IMPLIED REJECTION .  AS REGARDS THE EXPRESS DECISION OF REJECTION CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF MARCH 1969, WHILST THIS LETTER SETS OUT THE GROUNDS FOR ADHERING TO THE PREVIOUS DECISION, IT NEVERTHELESS CONTAINS NO NEW FACTOR RELATING TO THE POSITION IN LAW OR IN FACT EXISTING AT THE TIME OF THE IMPLIED REJECTION OF THE ORIGINAL DECISION .  ACCORDINGLY IT AMOUNTS TO A MEASURE LIMITED TO CONFIRMING THE PREVIOUS MEASURE AND FOR THAT REASON NOT CAPABLE OF ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE PERSON CONCERNED .  
Decision on costs
