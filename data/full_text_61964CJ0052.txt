Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE APPLICANT IN GRADE L/A4, STEP 5; 
Grounds
P.ADMISSIBILITY  THE APPLICANT HAS REFERRED TO THE COURT THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSION TO TAKE A DECISION ON HIS LETTERS OF JULY AND SEPTEMBER CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION AWARDED HIM BY DECISION OF SEPTEMBER . THE DEFENDANT MAINTAINS THAT HIS APPLICATION WAS IN FACT AGAINST THE DECISION OF SEPTEMBER AND THAT IT WAS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE FOR BEING OUT OF TIME .  UNDER ARTICLE 91() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS APPEALS MUST BE FILED WITHIN A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION TO THE PERSON CONCERNED OF THE DECISION IN DISPUTE .  A REQUEST OR COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS WHICH IS NOT MADE WITHIN THIS PERIOD CANNOT, UPON THE EXPIRY OF THIS PERIOD, ESCAPE BEING TIME-BARRED .  IN THIS INSTANCE THE DECISION OF SEPTEMBER CLASSIFYING THE APPLICANT WAS NOTIFIED TO HIM BY OCTOBER AT THE LATEST . HIS REQUEST OR COMPLAINT OF JULY WAS THUS MADE AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE 91() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE FACT THAT THE APPLICANT WAS INFORMED THAT HIS REQUEST OR COMPLAINT WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION CANNOT CAUSE THIS PERIOD TO START TO RUN AFRESH . IN FACT, SUCH A TEMPORIZING REPLY AMOUNTS TO A FAILURE TO GIVE A DECISION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE . IT COULD NOT, THEREFORE, RE-OPEN THE PERIOD FOR BRINGING AN APPEAL TO THE COURT .  THE APPLICANT RELIES ON THE NEW FACTOR WHICH, HE MAINTAINS, IS CONSTITUTED BY THE JUDGMENT IN CASE 70/DELIVERED ON JULY IN AN ACTION BETWEEN THE COURT AND ONE OF ITS SERVANTS . THE JUDGMENT ANNULLED AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION REGARDING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THAT SERVANT .  THE ONLY PERSONS CONCERNED BY THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF A JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ANNULLING A MEASURE TAKEN BY AN INSTITUTION ARE PARTIES TO THE ACTION AND THOSE PERSONS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE MEASURE WHICH IS ANNULLED . SUCH A JUDGMENT CAN ONLY CONSTITUTE A NEW FACTOR AND CAUSE THE PERIODS FOR BRINGING APPEALS TO RUN AFRESH AS REGARDS THESE PARTIES AND PERSONS .  AS THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THIS INSTANCE THE APPLICATION IS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS APPLICATION .  UNDER ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HOWEVER, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN PROCEEDINGS BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS .  
Operative part
THE COURT ( SECOND CHAMBER )  HEREBY :  . DISMISSES APPLICATION NO 52/AS INADMISSIBLE;  . ORDERS THE APPLICANT TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE ACTION, APART FROM THOSE INCURRED BY THE DEFENDANT .
