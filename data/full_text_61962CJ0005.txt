. AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY IS ADMISSIBLE ONLY IF THE HIGH AUTHORITY HAS TAKEN NO DECISION IN RELATION TO THE MATTER REFERRED TO IN THE NOTICES OF THE PARTIES CONCERNED .  . THERE IS NO LEGITIMATE GROUND FOR COMPLAINING OF A FAILURE TO ACT WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS AT THE TIME THE PROCEEDINGS ARE INSTITUTED .

ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY CONFERRING ON THE HIGH AUTHORITY THE POWER TO 'OBTAIN THE INFORMATION IT REQUIRES' AND TO 'HAVE ANY NECESSARY CHECKS MADE' IS FORMULATED VERY WIDELY .  THE LIMIT OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY'S POWERS WHEN APPLYING THAT ARTICLE IS DETERMINED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHECKS .  .

Subject of the case
APPLICATION  ( A ) AS TO CASES TO 11/:  . FOR ANNULMENT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY OF AN IMPLIED DECISION OF REFUSAL BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY TO WITHDRAW ITS DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF INVOICES RELATING TO ELECTRIC ENERGY USED BY THE APPLICANTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, TO CONFIRM THIS DEMAND IN THE FORM OF A DECISION APPLYING TO ALL UNDERTAKINGS IN THE SAME SECTOR;  . FOR ANNULMENT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY ORDERING THE APPLICANTS TO FURNISH IT WITH INVOICES FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY TO ENABLE THE TONNAGES DECLARED BY THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS, AND WHICH ARE THE BASIS FOR THE EQUALIZATION CONTRIBUTION, TO BE CHECKED;  ( B ) AS TO CASES TO 15/:  FOR ANNULMENT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE ECSC TREATY OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY ORDERING THE APPLICANTS TO FURNISH IT WITH INVOICES OF ELECTRIC ENERGY TO ENABLE THE TONNAGES DECLARED BY THE APPLICANT UNDERTAKINGS, AND WHICH ARE THE BASIS FOR THE EQUALIZATION CONTRIBUTION, TO BE CHECKED;  
Grounds
P . I - AS TO ADMISSIBILITY  THE PARTIES HAVE NOT OBJECTED THAT THE PROCEDURE WAS IN ANY WAY IRREGULAR .  THE LETTER DESCRIBED BY THE APPLICANTS AS A FORMAL NOTICE UNDER ARTICLE AND DATED DECEMBER WAS RECEIVED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY ON DECEMBER . THE LATTER TOOK A DECISION ON FEBRUARY WHICH REACHED THE APPLICANTS ON MARCH 1962, ACCORDING TO THEIR STATEMENT WHICH WAS NOT CONTRADICTED BY THE DEFENDANT .  THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY 1962, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS CONSIDERED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY AS A REPLY TO THE APPLICANTS' NOTICES, MEETS IN FACT THE DESIRE EXPRESSED BY THEM, NAMELY 'TO TAKE A PRELIMINARY DECISION UNDER ARTICLE IN WHICH ( THE HIGH AUTHORITY ) GIVES A RULING ON ALL THE POINTS IN DISPUTE SET OUT IN THIS LETTER '.  WITHOUT DEALING EXPRESSLY WITH ALL THE POINTS CONTAINED IN THE LETTER OF DECEMBER 1961, SOME OF WHICH APPEAR TO BE OF DOUBTFUL RELEVANCE, THE DECISION SETTLED, AT LEAST INDIRECTLY, THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE APPLICANTS, THUS OPENING FOR THEM THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  THE FACT THAT THIS INDIRECT REPLY DIFFERS FROM THAT SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS CANNOT OPEN THE WAY FOR PROCEEDINGS UNDER ARTICLE 35, BECAUSE THAT PROVISION WOULD APPLY ONLY IF THE HIGH AUTHORITY HAD MADE NO DECISION ON THE MATTER REFERRED TO IN THE APPLICANTS' NOTICES .  THE APPLICANTS, MOREOVER, SEEM TO SHARE THIS OPINION AS, AT THE SAME TIME AND WITH IDENTICAL ARGUMENTS, THEY HAVE BROUGHT AN ACTION UNDER ARTICLE AGAINST THE DECISION IN QUESTION .  THE APPLICANTS ALLEGE THAT THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE WAS NOT OBSERVED, SINCE THE DECISION OF FEBRUARY DID NOT REACH THEM UNTIL MARCH .  P . IT IS NOT NECESSARY IN THIS CASE TO SETTLE WHETHER A DECISION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY SHOULD NOT MERELY BE TAKEN BUT WHETHER IT SHOULD ALSO BE COMMUNICATED WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS, FOR IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT THE DECISION REACHED THE APPLICANTS BEFORE THEY BROUGHT THEIR ACTION FOR FAILURE TO ACT .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE APPLICANTS HAD NO LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINING OF A FAILURE TO ACT WHICH NO LONGER EXISTED AT THE TIME THE ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT, SINCE THEIR LEGAL PROTECTION WAS SUFFICIENTLY ASSURED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING AN APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACTIONS FOR FAILURE TO ACT MUST BE RULED TO BE INADMISSIBLE OWING TO LACK OF LEGAL INTEREST .  THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS NOT DISPUTED AND IN THIS CASE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR THE COURT TO RAISE THE MATTER OF ITS OWN MOTION .  II - ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CASE  THE APPLICANTS ALLEGE THE LACK OR INSUFFICIENCY OF GROUNDS, INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY, ESPECIALLY OF ARTICLE 47, AND MISUSE OF POWERS WITH REGARD TO THE DECISIONS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF FEBRUARY . EACH OF THESE THREE SUBMISSIONS IS QUOTED UNDER SEVERAL HEADS .  ( A ) FIRST, THE APPLICANTS ASSERT THAT THE DECISIONS OF FEBRUARY ARE VITIATED BY INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY AND MISUSE OF POWERS, BECAUSE THEY CALL UPON THE APPLICANTS TO SEND TO THE HIGH AUTHORITY THE INVOICES RELATING TO THE VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMED BY THEM AND TO CERTIFY THAT THESE INVOICES COVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY USED .  THE COMPLAINT ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY IS NOT WELL FOUNDED . THE LIMIT OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY'S POWERS WHEN APPLYING ARTICLE IS DETERMINED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHECKS . IN THIS CASE, THE DEMANDS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE INVOICES AND FOR A CERTIFICATE THAT THE DOCUMENTS SUPPLIED COVER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ELECTRIC ENERGY CONSUMED BY THE UNDERTAKING DURING THE PERIOD IN QUESTION DO NOT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSTITUTE AN EXCESSIVE REQUIREMENT ON THE PART OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  FURTHER, THE COMPLAINT OF MISUSE OF POWERS ARISING FROM THE FACT THAT THE SAME ORDERS WERE NOT MADE BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY TO ALL UNDERTAKINGS IS NOT WELL FOUNDED . IN FACT, THE HIGH AUTHORITY ASSERTED DURING THE ORAL PROCEDURE, WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY DENIAL FROM THE APPLICANTS, THAT ALL UNDERTAKINGS USING ELECTRIC FURNACES HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO SUBMIT TO THE SAME CHECKS AND THAT ORDERS IDENTICAL TO THOSE CONTAINED IN THE DISPUTED DECISIONS WERE SENT TO ALL THE UNDERTAKINGS WHICH DID NOT COMPLY WITH THAT DEMAND .  P . ( B ) THE APPLICANTS ALLEGE THAT THE DECISIONS OF FEBRUARY ARE VITIATED BY LACK OF REASONING AND BY INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY, BECAUSE THE INVOICES FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRIC ENERGY DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VALID MEANS OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF SCRAP USED .  THE COMPLAINTS OF THE APPLICANTS ARE NOT WELL FOUNDED . IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE VERY TERMS OF THE DECISIONS OF FEBRUARY 1962, THE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRIC ENERGY BY FURNACES IS ONLY ONE OF THE FACTORS ON WHICH THE HIGH AUTHORITY WAS TO BASE ITS DETERMINATION OF THE TONNAGES TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR THE EQUALIZATION CONTRIBUTION .  EVEN THOUGH, AS THE HIGH AUTHORITY RECOGNIZES MOREOVER, THE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY IS NOT BY ITSELF SUFFICIENT TO CALCULATE THE CONSUMPTION OF SCRAP, IT MAY NONETHELESS BE A VALID BASIS FOR VERIFICATION WHEN TAKEN WITH OTHER FACTORS .  MOREOVER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE UNDERTAKINGS SUBSEQUENTLY TO DISCUSS THE AMOUNT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION AND THE BASES ON WHICH IT WAS FIXED .  ( C ) THE APPLICANTS CLAIM THAT THESE SAME DECISIONS ARE VITIATED BY LACK OF REASONING AND BY INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY BECAUSE THE POWERS CONFERRED ON THE HIGH AUTHORITY DO NOT ALLOW IT TO ORDER THAT THE DOCUMENTS SUBJECTED TO CHECKING BE PRESENTED AT LUXEMBOURG .  THE COMPLAINT CONCERNING LACK OF REASONING IS NOT WELL FOUNDED . IN FACT ARTICLE OF THE TREATY CONFERRING ON THE HIGH AUTHORITY THE POWER TO 'OBTAIN THE INFORMATION IT REQUIRES' AND TO 'HAVE ANY NECESSARY CHECKS MADE' IS FORMULATED VERY WIDELY . IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR PARTICULAR REASONS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AT LUXEMBOURG .  FURTHERMORE, THE COMPLAINT CONCERNING THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE TREATY IS NOT WELL FOUNDED . THE APPLICANTS WERE WRONG IN MAINTAINING THAT THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHECKS MUST BE LIMITED TO INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT BY OFFICIALS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY AT THE PLACE OF BUSINESS OF THE UNDERTAKINGS DURING NORMAL WORKING HOURS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, WHICH CONFERS ON INSPECTORS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY THE POWERS CONFERRED BY THE LAWS OF MEMBER STATES ON OFFICIALS OF THEIR OWN REVENUE DEPARTMENTS - IN THIS CASE THE ITALIAN REVENUE AUTHORITIES - AND THAT ITALIAN LAW DOES NOT PERMIT REVENUE OFFICIALS TO REQUIRE THAT DOCUMENTS WHICH THEY CONSIDER NECESSARY FOR THEIR INVESTIGATIONS BE SENT TO THEIR OFFICES .  P . THIS ARGUMENT MUST BE REJECTED . THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ARE NOT INTENDED TO DEFINE THE EXTENT OF THE POWER WHICH IS CONFERRED ON THE HIGH AUTHORITY BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY TO OBTAIN INFROMATION AND TO MAKE CHECKS; IT IS MERELY INTENDED TO PUT AT THE HIGH AUTHORITY'S DISPOSAL THE COMPULSORY POWERS AFFORDED BY NATIONAL REVENUE LAWS FOR THE DIRECT AND COMPULSORY EXECUTION BY ITS OWN OFFICIALS OF INSPECTIONS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE AREA OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND OF DEPARTING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF THE INVIOLABILITY OF PRIVATE PREMISES .  AS THERE IS NO EXPRESS RULE ON THIS MATTER IN COMMUNITY LAW, IT IS FOR THE COURT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MEASURES OF INVESTIGATION TAKEN BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY WERE EXCESSIVE . IN THIS CASE, AND HAVING REGARD TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE INVOICES AT LUXEMBOURG WAS NOT EXCESSIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE AIM IN VIEW . THE INSPECTIONS PREVIOUSLY CARRIED OUT ON THE SPOT BY OFFICIALS OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY AND OF THE SWISS TRUST COMPANY GAVE REASONS FOR SERIOUSLY DOUBTING THE VERACITY OF THE DECLARATIONS MADE BY CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS WITH REGARD TO THEIR CONSUMPTION OF SCRAP . CONSEQUENTLY, CHECKING IN DETAIL IN THE OFFICES OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY CONSTITUTED A MORE ADEQUATE METHOD AND ONE WHICH MOREOVER WAS LESS LIKELY TO DISTURB THE FUNCTIONING OF THE UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED THAN FRESH INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT ON THEIR PREMISES .  FINALLY, THE APPLICANTS POINTED OUT DURING THE ORAL PROCEDURE THAT THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO ITALIAN LAW, INVOICES HAVE TO BE KEPT FOR ONLY FIVE YEARS MIGHT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PRODUCE INVOICES FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY RELATING TO THE PERIOD FROM APRIL TO NOVEMBER 1958, AS REQUIRED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  THIS OBJECTION RAISED BY THE APPLICANTS CANNOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE DISPUTED DECISIONS . IT IS FOR THE HIGH AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE NON-PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN INVOICES IS JUSTIFIED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROVISIONS OF THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION AND DRAWING THE APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM .  FOR THESE REASONS THE APPLICATIONS AGAINST THE DECISIONS OF FEBRUARY MUST BE RULED TO BE UNFOUNDED .  
Decision on costs
UNDER ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . THE APPLICANTS HAVE FAILED IN ALL THEIR SUBMISSIONS AND MUST THEREFORE BEAR THE COSTS .
