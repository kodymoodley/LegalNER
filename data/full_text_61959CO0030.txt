HAVING REGARD TO THE WRITTEN OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PARTIES IN THE MAIN ACTION;  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY HAS ESTABLISHED AN INTEREST IN THE RESULT OF THE CASE SUBMITTED TO THE COURT, PURSUANT TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC STATUTE .  THE APPLICATION TO INTERVENE IS, UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE ECSC STATUTE, ADMISSIBLE IF IT SEEKS TO SUPPORT OR REQUEST REJECTION OF THE SUBMISSIONS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES IN THE MAIN ACTION, THE ADMISSIBILITY OR OTHERWISE OF INTERVENTION BEING DETERMINED SOLELY BY ITS PURPOSE AND NOT BY THE NATURE OF THE SUBMISSIONS RELIED UPON BY THE INTERVENER .

IT IS ONLY WHEN HIS INTERVENTION IS ALLOWED THAT, WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE APPLICATION OF PARAGRAPH ( C ) OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF MARCH 1959, THE INTERVENER IS OBLIGED TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE CASE REQUIRED IN THE MAIN ACTION .
