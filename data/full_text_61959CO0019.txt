Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE AND OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION N . 17/OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF FEBRUARY ON THE EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORIZATIONS CONCERNING THE SALES ORGANIZATIONS OF THE RUHR BASIN, PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL N . OF MARCH 1959, 
Grounds
P . BY APPLICATION LODGED ON MARCH 1959, THE APPLICANTS REQUESTED SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF ARTICLE AND OF THE SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF DECISION N . 17/OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF FEBRUARY .  THAT APPLICATION, BASED ON ARTICLE OF THE TREATY, WAS REFERRED TO THE COURT BY DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF THE PROTOCOL ON THE STATUTE AND TO ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE .  ARTICLE OF THE DECISION  THE APPLICANTS REQUEST THE COURT TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION, NOT OF ALL THE PROVISIONS OF DECISION N . 17/WHICH RELATE TO THE SUPPLYING OF FIRST-HAND WHOLESALE COAL MERCHANTS, BUT ONLY OF ARTICLE .  THAT ARTICLE REJECTS THE FURTHER CLAIMS FORMULATED BY THE MINING UNDERTAKINGS CONCERNED WITH REGARD TO REGULATION OF TRADE .  THUS, TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANIES PROVIDE FOR MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATION OF TRADE THAN THAT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF ARTICLES TO OF THE DECISION, THE HIGH AUTHORITY REFUSES THE APPLICANTS THE AUTHORIZATION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE ( ) OF THE TREATY .  P . ARTICLE THEREFORE CONSTITUTES A REFUSAL OF AUTHORIZATION .  SINCE THE SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A DECISION OF REJECTION IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO A GRANT OF THE AUTHORIZATION REFUSED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY, IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE INTERIM APPLICATION IS IRRELEVANT .  IN ANY EVENT THAT AUTHORIZATION MAY BE GRANTED ONLY BY THE ADMINISTRATION, OVER WHICH THE COURT HAS NO POWER OF DIRECTION .  THE OTHER INTERIM MEASURES REFERRED TO IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE CAN ONLY BE OF A CONSERVATORY NATURE AND DO NOT GIVE THE COURT THE POWER TO SUBSTITUTE ITSELF FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OR TAKE, EVEN PROVISIONALLY, ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS IN PLACE OF THE EXECUTIVE .  AS REGARDS ARTICLE THE APPLICATION FOR SUSPENSION OF OPERATION MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  SECOND SENTENCE OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE DECISION  SO FAR THE APPLICANTS HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE LAW, THAT THE INSPECTIONS PRESCRIBED BY THE CONTESTED PROVISION WOULD CAUSE THEM DAMAGE WHICH COULD NOT BE REDRESSED IF THAT PROVISION WERE ANNULLED AT THE HEARING OF THE MAIN ACTION .  THERE IS THEREFORE NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE GRANT OF A SUSPENSION OF OPERATION AT PRESENT .  FURTHERMORE, ARTICLE OF THE DECISION DOES NOT APPEAR TO DEROGATE FROM THE POWERS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLES 47, ( ) AND OF THE TREATY; IT WILL ONLY BE POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH THE EXTENT, AND HENCE THE LEGALITY, OF THE POWERS CONFERRED ON THE INSPECTORS IN THE LIGHT OF THE INSTRUCTIONS TO BE LAID DOWN BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY IN THAT CONNEXION .  
Operative part
