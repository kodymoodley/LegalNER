Subject of the case
APPLICATION UNDER THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY FOR A RULING THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO OF THE COUNCIL ON THE PROGRESSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET IN WINE ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1962, P . ) AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 92/63/EEC OF THE COUNCIL ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1964, P . ) BY ITS FAILURE TO PREPARE A VITICULTURAL LAND REGISTER WITHIN THE PERIOD FIXED BY THE SAID ARTICLE, 
Grounds
THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE DISPUTE  FOLLOWING ITS REASONED OPINION OF FEBRUARY 1969, THE COMMISSION BY AN APPLICATION LODGED ON JULY REQUESTED THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY " TO DECLARE THAT THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC, BY FAILING TO PREPARE THE VITICULTURAL LAND REGISTER WITHIN THE PERIOD FIXED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1962, P . ), AS AMENDED BY REGULATION NO 92/63/EEC ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1964, P . ), HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PROVISION ".  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE AND FROM THE ORAL PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS THAT THE COMMISSION IS REQUESTING THE COURT TO RULE WHETHER THE FAILURE EXISTED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD FIXED BY THE REASONED OPINION .  SUBSTANCE  THE APPLICANT CONSIDERS THAT THE DUTY IMPOSED UPON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES REFERS TO THE COMPLETION OF A REGISTER CAPABLE OF FULFILLING ITS PURPOSE, WHILST ACCORDING TO THE DEFENDANT IT ONLY RELATES TO THE CREATION OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A REGISTER .  IN SUPPORT OF ITS INTERPRETATION THE DEFENDANT FIRST OF ALL INVOKES THE ITALIAN VERSION OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO WHICH IS WORDED AS FOLLOWS : " ENTRO IL GIUGNO GLI STATI MEMBRI ISTITUISCONO UN CATASTO VITICOLO CHE SARA TENUTO AGGIORNATO ".  IN ITS VIEW THE TERM " PREPARE " ( " ISTITUIRE " ) HAS THE SAME LEGAL IMPLICATIONS AS " PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR ".  AS A COMPARISON OF THE FOUR VERSIONS OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROVISION IN THE VARIOUS LANGUAGES DOES NOT LEAD TO A DECISIVE RESULT, THE MEANING OF REGULATION NO 24, PARTICULARLY ARTICLE THEREOF, MUST BE ANALYSED .  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THAT PROVISION : " THIS REGISTER, BASED ON THE GENERAL VINEYARD CENSUS, SHALL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM INFORMATION :  ( A ) THE TOTAL AREA UNDER VINES;  ( B ) THE AREA UNDER VINES SUBDIVIDED ACCORDING TO TYPE OF PRODUCTION;  ( C ) THE METHOD OF MANAGEMENT OF PLANTATIONS;  ( D ) THE CLASSIFICATION OF VINE PLANTATIONS ACCORDING TO SURFACE AREA;  ( E ) THE CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS UNDER VINES ACCORDING TO AGE OF VINE-STOCKS;  ( F ) CLASSIFICATION OF VINE VARIETIES ACCORDING TO YEAR OF PLANTING ".  IT FOLLOWS FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THAT THE " REGISTER " WAS REQUIRED TO INCLUDE ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED INFORMATION AND COMPRISE A COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS LIST . SUCH AN INTERPRETATION IS CONFIRMED BY THE REQUIREMENT THAT THIS INFORMATION SHALL BE " KEPT UP TO DATE " IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE SAID ARTICLE, WHICH CLEARLY PRESUPPOSES THAT THE INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED . IT IS ALSO CONFIRMED BY THE CONTENT OF REGULATION NO 92/63/EEC BY WHICH THE COUNCIL, ON A PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION, EXTENDED UNTIL DECEMBER THE PERIOD FIXED BY REGULATION NO FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE VITICULTURAL LAND REGISTER .  IN FACT BY A LETTER OF MARCH ADDRESSED TO THE COMMISSION, THE DEFENDANT HAD REQUESTED THIS EXTENSION STATING THAT IF THE APPLICANT' S INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO WERE ACCEPTED IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD BE " A PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY TO COMPLETE ALL THE NECESSARY WORK BY JUNE ", SINCE " COMPLEX AND ONEROUS SURVEYS " WERE REQUIRED . THIS ARGUMENT CONFIRMS THE INTERPRETATION THAT THE REGULATION INTENDS TO OBLIGE THE MEMBER STATES TO SET UP WITHIN THE PERIOD IN QUESTION A REGISTER CAPABLE OF FULFILLING ITS PURPOSE .  AGAINST THIS INTERPRETATION, THE DEFENDANT POINTS OUT THAT REGULATION NO OF THE COMMISSION ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1962, P . ), RELATING SOLELY TO THE " INITIAL PROVISIONS " FOR PREPARING THE VITICULTURAL LAND REGISTER, WAS ONLY ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER 1962, THAT IS, APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE JUNE 1963, THE DATE OF THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD FIXED BY ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 24, WHILST REGULATION NO 26/64/EEC OF THE COMMISSION ( OJ, SPECIAL EDITION - 1964, P . ), WHICH SETTLED MANY OF THE DETAILS RELATING TO THE ACTUAL FORM OF THE REGISTER, WAS ONLY ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY 1964, THAT IS, AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD . IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, ACCORDING TO THE DEFENDANT, THE INTERPRETATION PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT AMOUNTS TO " MAKING THE ACTUAL EXTENT OF THE PERIOD ( IN QUESTION ) DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE DISPATCH WITH WHICH THE COMMISSION ADOPTED THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS . "  THE SAID DELAYS IN ADOPTING THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS DO NOT PROVIDE GROUNDS FOR PUTTING FORWARD AN INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION NO DIFFERING FROM THAT WHICH EMERGES FROM ITS WORDING, ITS SENSE AND ITS PURPOSE . MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH SUCH DELAYS DO NOT GIVE GROUNDS FOR THE COMPLAINT THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS EXCEEDED THE PERIOD LAID DOWN AND EXTENDED TO DECEMBER 1964, THEY MAY NOT ON THE OTHER HAND BE INVOKED TO EXCUSE THE FACT THAT ON THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE REASONED OPINION IT HAD STILL TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER REGULATION NO .  FROM THOSE CONSIDERATIONS AS A WHOLE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MEMBER STATES WERE BOUND UNDER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED REGULATIONS TO SET UP A REGISTER CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CRITERIA LAID DOWN BY REGULATION NO . NEVERTHELESS, IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD NOT PREPARED SUCH A REGISTER BY THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD FIXED BY THE REASONED OPINION . DECREE NO OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC OF DECEMBER 1965, PUBLISHED IN THE GAZZETTA UFFICIALE OF MAY 1966, DOES NOT FULFIL THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION NO SINCE IT MERELY CREATES THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS MAKING POSSIBLE THE SUBSEQUENT ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGISTER AS LAID DOWN IN THAT REGULATION .  THE DEFENDANT HAS ADMITTED THAT THE BODY OF IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS REQUIRED BY THAT DECREE HAS NOT YET BEEN TAKEN . IT MUST THEREFORE BE DECLARED THAT BY ITS FAILURE TO PREPARE THE VITICULTURAL LAND REGISTER THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO .  
Decision on costs
UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS AND MUST THEREFORE BEAR THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS .
