Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE ANNULMENT OF THE DECISION OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF OCTOBER NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT BY REGISTERED LETTER OF NOVEMBER IMPOSING ON THE APPLICANTS A FINE OF LIT 000, 
Grounds
P . A - INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY  THE APPLICANT COMPLAINS THAT THE HIGH AUTHORITY IMPOSED THE CONTESTED FINE WITHOUT HAVING PREVIOUSLY GIVEN IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT ITS COMMENTS PURSUANT TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY . IN THIS CONNEXION, IT CLAIMS THAT THE REGISTERED LETTER SENT BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY ON NOVEMBER 1955, WHICH, WITHOUT ANY DOUBT, CONSTITUTED AN INVITATION SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAID PROVISION, NEVER ARRIVED AT MAGLIANO ALPI, WHERE THE WORKS OF THE APPLICANT COMPANY ARE SITUATED, SINCE THE ADDRESS CONTAINED SPELLING ERRORS .  IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHETHER THIS COMPLAINT IS ALSO, OR EXCLUSIVELY, ONE OF INFRINGEMENT OF ESSENTIAL PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS, SINCE THE COURT IS OF THE OPINION THAT IT IS UNFOUNDED .  THE HIGH AUTHORITY HAS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT A PHOTOCOPY OF THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED LETTER, BEARING THE SEAL OF ALMA, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CHALLENGED . IT HAS THEREFORE SHOWN THAT THE LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO AN EMPLOYEE OF THE APPLICANT AT A BUILDING SITUATED AT CORSO REGIO PARCO, TURIN, BEING THE ADDRESS WHICH THE APPLICANT, IN ITS APPLICATION, STATES TO BE THAT OF ITS REGISTERED OFFICE .  P . THIS BEING SO, IT IS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE WHETHER THE LETTER - AS STATED BY THE APPLICANT - WAS NOT CONVEYED FROM TURIN TO MAGLIANO ALPI . SINCE IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IT DULY ARRIVED AT THE APPLICANT'S REGISTERED OFFICE, APPLICATION MAY BE MADE OF A PRINCIPLE OF LAW RECOGNIZED IN ALL COUNTRIES OF THE COMMUNITY, NAMELY THAT A WRITTEN DECLARATION OF INTENT BECOMES EFFECTIVE AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES IN DUE COURSE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE ADDRESSEE .  THE SUBMISSION CONCERNING INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE MUST THEREFORE BE REJECTED .  B - INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY  ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT, THE HIGH AUTHORITY FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY; IT CLAIMS THAT THE OFFENCE OF WHICH IT WAS GUILTY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHED ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE .  THIS ARGUMENT MUST BE REJECTED .  ACCORDING TO ARTICLE FINES MAY BE IMPOSED UPON UNDERTAKINGS WHICH INFRINGE THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER V OF THE TREATY OR DECISIONS TAKEN THEREUNDER BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY . THAT CHAPTER COVERS OFFENCES AGAINST THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING PUBLICATION OF PRICE LISTS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, CONTAINED IN ARTICLE ( ) ( A ), AS WELL AS OFFENCES AGAINST THE RULE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION . SINCE THE APPLICANT DID NOT FULFIL ITS OBLIGATION TO PUBLISH ITS PRICE LISTS, AS WELL AS INFRINGING THE HIGH AUTHORITY'S DECISIONS NOS 31/53, 2/AND 37/54, LAYING DOWN THE EXTENT AND MANNER OF SUCH PUBLICATION, THE HIGH AUTHORITY CORRECTLY APPLIED ARTICLE TO IT .  CONTRARY TO THE APPLICANT'S BELIEF, THE TREATY IS NOT INFRINGED WHEN THE HIGH AUTHORITY DETERMINES THE EXTENT AND MANNER OF PUBLICATION OF PRICE LISTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) OF THE TREATY, LAYING DOWN, INTER ALIA, THAT THOSE LISTS SHALL BE COMMUNICATED TO IT . AS ITS AGENT HAS NOTED, ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) MUST BE VIEWED IN THIS CONNEXION AS A SPECIAL PROVISION IN RELATION TO ARTICLE .  THE APPLICANT WRONGLY MAINTAINS THAT THE ARGUMENT ADDUCED BY THE HIGH AUTHORITY WOULD LEAD TO ABSURD CONSEQUENCES IN THAT IT WOULD ALLOW THE IMPOSITION OF VERY HEAVY FINES IN RESPECT OF INFRINGEMENTS OF PURELY PREVENTIVE PROVISIONS . IN FACT, ARTICLE DOES NOT LAY DOWN A MINIMUM; IT THEREFORE ALLOWS AND REQUIRES THE HIGH AUTHORITY TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE IN RELATION TO THE NATURE OF THE RULE INFRINGED . FURTHERMORE, THE RULES RELATING TO PUBLICATION OF PRICES ARE NOT OF MINOR IMPORTANCE, BUT ARE ON THE CONTRARY A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMON MARKET .  THE SUBMISSION CONCERNING INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE MUST THEREFORE ALSO BE REJECTED .  C - AMOUNT OF THE FINE  THE COURT HAS EXAMINED THE QUESTION WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE SHOULD BE REDUCED .  IT NOTES THAT THE ACTION BEFORE IT IS ONE IN WHICH IT HAS UNLIMITED JURISDICTION ( SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ) AND THAT, THEREFORE, IT IS EMPOWERED NOT ONLY TO ANNUL BUT ALSO TO AMEND THE DECISION WHICH HAS BEEN ADOPTED .  P . ALTHOUGH THE APPLICANT HAS PUT FORWARD NO FORMAL SUBMISSION TO THIS EFFECT, THE COURT BELIEVES, THE ADVOCATE-GENERAL CONCURRING, THAT THAT PART OF THE APPLICATION STRESSING THE MODEST FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE APPLICANT MAY BE INTERPRETED AS AN ALTERNATIVE SUBMISSION REQUESTING SUCH A REDUCTION . FURTHERMORE, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY FORMAL SUBMISSION, THE COURT IS AUTHORIZED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AN EXCESSIVE FINE SINCE SUCH A RESULT WOULD NOT HAVE AN EFFECT ULTRA PETITA, BUT WOULD ON THE CONTRARY AMOUNT TO A PARTIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE APPLICATION . IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE ADVOCATE-GENERAL THE COURT IS, HOWEVER, OF THE OPINION THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE IS NOT EXCESSIVE IN THIS CASE . AS REGARDS THE GRAVITY OF THE OFFENCE, ACCOUNT SHOULD BE TAKEN OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PUBLICATION OF PRICES, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF THE FACT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT THE APPLICANT PERSISTENTLY DISREGARDED THE RULES IN QUESTION FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS, THEREBY BETRAYING CONSIDERABLE NEGLIGENCE AT THE VERY LEAST . FURTHERMORE, AS REGARDS THE APPLICANT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION THE COURT REFERS TO THE FIGURES QUOTED IN THE ADVOCATE-GENERAL'S OPINION . IT NOTES, MOREOVER, THAT THE ACCOUNTS FOR AND CONTAIN ITEMS ON THE DEBIT SIDE ENTITLED " EXTRAORDINARY RESERVE FUND ", AMOUNTING TO LIT AND RESPECTIVELY . THIS BEING THE CASE, NO MANIFEST INJUSTICE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE COURT DOES NOT INTEND TO SUBSTITUTE ITS ASSESSMENT FOR THAT OF THE HIGH AUTHORITY .  THE COURT IS NOT UNAWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH THE APPLICANT MAY ENCOUNTER AS THE RESULT OF THE COINCIDENCE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO PAY THE FINE AND DISCHARGE ARREARS IN RESPECT OF LEVIES . THE COURT RELIES ON THE HIGH AUTHORITY'S JUDGMENT REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FINE IS TO BE PAID .  
Decision on costs
SINCE THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN ALL HEADS OF ITS APPLICATION IT MUST BEAR THE COSTS OF THE ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COURT . 
Operative part
