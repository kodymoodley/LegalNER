Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE DECISIONS OF THE COMMISSION OF THE EEC OF 23, AND JUNE FIXING C.I.F . PRICES FOR SORGHUM ( OFFICIAL JOURNAL, AGRICULTURAL SUPPLEMENT OF JULY 1964, PP . ET SEQ .); 
Grounds
P.THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION  THE CONTESTED DECISIONS ARE ADDRESSED TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY .  THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY PROVIDES THAT ANY NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON MAY INTITUTE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST A DECISION WHICH IS NOT ADDRESSED TO THAT PERSON, ON CONDITION THAT IT IS OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THAT PERSON .  THE DEFENDANT MAINTAINS THAT THE CONTESTED DECISION IS NOT OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT, WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT PROVISION .  PERSONS OTHER THAN THOSE TO WHOM A DECISION IS ADDRESSED MAY ONLY CLAIM TO BE INDIVIDUALLY CONCERNED IF THAT DECISION AFFECTS THEM BY REASON OF CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO THEM OR BY REASON OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATED FROM ALL OTHER PERSONS AND BY VIRTUE OF THESE FACTORS DISTINGUISHES THEM INDIVIDUALLY JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE PERSON ADDRESSED .  THE APPLICANT CLAIMS TO BE IN A SPECIAL SITUATION AS REGARDS THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTESTED DECISION, IN THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT BELONG TO A GROUP OF IMPORTERS AFFECTED BY THE SAID DECISION BUT ALSO THAT ITS REQUEST FOR AN IMPORT LICENCE, MADE ON JUNE 1964, DISTINGUISHES IT FROM ALL OTHER IMPORTERS .  THIS CLAIM IS UNFOUNDED .  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO MEASURES SUCH AS THE CONTESTED DECISION THAT ITS EFFECTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE LIMITED TO IMPORTS ALONE BUT EXTEND ALSO TO EXPORTS OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION, EITHER TO OTHER MEMBER STATES OR TO THIRD COUNTRIES .  MOREOVER, THE PURELY FORTUITOUS FACT THAT AFTER THE CONTESTED DECISION WAS MADE ONLY THE APPLICANT CONSIDERED IT ADVISABLE TO APPLY FOR AN IMPORT LICENCE ON THE DATE IN QUESTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE OTHER IMPORTERS AND TO DISTINGUISH IT INDIVIDUALLY AS REQUIRED BY ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  IN VIEW OF THE ABOVE, THE CONTESTED DECISION CANNOT BE REGARDED AS OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT .  THIS BEING SO, THE PRESENT APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT MUST BE DECLARED INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  HAVING FAILED IN ITS APPLICATION, THE APPLICANT MUST BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
