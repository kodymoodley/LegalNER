++++IN CASE 31/REFERENCE TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY BY THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK, ROTTERDAM, FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THAT COURT BETWEEN  SA CHANEL, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE ( FRANCE ),  AND  CEPEHA HANDELSMAATSCHAPPIJ NV, HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE IN ROTTERDAM,  
Subject of the case
ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY ( AND OF THE RULES GOVERNING ITS APPLICATION ), 
Grounds
BY JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER RECEIVED AT THE REGISTRY ON DECEMBER THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK, ROTTERDAM, MADE A REFERENCE TO THE COURT FOR AN INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY .  THE COURT WAS NOTIFIED BY COMMUNICATION OF JANUARY FROM THE SAID COURT THAT AN APPEAL HAD BEEN LODGED AGAINST THAT JUDGMENT AND THAT AS A RESULT " EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENT IS DEFERRED ".  FOLLOWING THIS COMMUNICATION THE COURT DECIDED, BY ORDER OF JUNE 1969, TO SUSPEND JUDGMENT .  BY A LETTER RECEIVED AT THE REGISTRY ON JUNE 1970, THE REGISTRAR OF THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK INFORMED THE COURT THAT A JUDGMENT OF MAY OF THE GERECHTSHOF, THE HAGUE, HAD AMENDED THE JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER .  ACCORDINGLY THE REFERENCE FOR INTERPRETATION HAS LOST ITS PURPOSE .  THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES WHICH HAD SUBMITTED ITS OBSERVATIONS TO THE COURT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE . AS THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE, IN SO FAR AS THE PARTIES TO THE MAIN ACTION ARE CONCERNED, IN THE NATURE OF A STEP IN THE ACTION PENDING BEFORE THE ARRONDISSEMENTSRECHTBANK, ROTTERDAM, THE DECISION ON COSTS IS A MATTER FOR THAT COURT .
