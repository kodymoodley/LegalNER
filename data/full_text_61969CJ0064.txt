Summary
WHERE A MEASURE HAS THE CHARACTER OF A REGULATION THAT CHARACTER IS NOT CALLED IN ISSUE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER AND EVEN THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES AT A GIVEN MOMENT MAY BE DETERMINED MORE OR LESS PRECISELY, PROVIDED THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPLICATION DEPENDS ON AN OBJECTIVE LEGAL OR FACTUAL SITUATION DEFINED BY THE MEASURE WITH REFERENCE TO ITS PURPOSE .  THE FACT THAT A TRANSITIONAL PROVISION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS ARISING BEFORE A DATE FIXED BY IT AND, THEREFORE, OFTEN ESTABLISHED BEFORE IT COMES INTO FORCE, DOES NOT PREVENT THAT PROVISION FROM BEING AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FORMER AND NEW PROVISIONS WHICH IT IS DESIGNED TO RECONCILE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FROM PARTAKING OF THEIR GENERAL NATURE .

ARTICLE OF THE SAME REGULATION, IN SO FAR AS IT FIXES THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE SAID REGULATION AS AUGUST 1969, BY PROVIDING THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND SHALL TAKE EFFECT FROM AUGUST 1969,  
Grounds
IN AN APPLICATION LODGED ON OCTOBER THE APPLICANT HAS APPLIED FOR THE ANNULMENT OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1660/OF THE COMMISSION OF AUGUST ON CERTAIN MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AS A RESULT OF THE DEVALUATION OF THE FRENCH FRANC ( OJ L P . ) IN SO FAR AS IT PROVIDES IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE ( ) ( A ) THAT " WHERE A REFUND MAY BE FIXED IN ADVANCE THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOREGOING SUBPARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY UNLESS THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS MADE USE OF ", AND PROVIDES IN ARTICLE THAT ARTICLES AND SHALL TAKE EFFECT FROM AUGUST .  IN AN INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION LODGED AT THE REGISTRY ON NOVEMBER THE DEFENDANT HAS RAISED AN OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, CLAIMING THAT THE MEASURES IN QUESTION WERE REGULATIONS AND WERE NOT OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT .  IT IS THEREFORE FOR THE COURT TO EXAMINE IN THE LIGHT OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY WHETHER THE PROVISIONS WHICH FORMED THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE APPLICATION ARE MERELY IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION AND DO, IN REALITY, CONSTITUTE DECISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO THE APPLICANT .  THE REGULATION IN QUESTION WAS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE OF REGULATION ( EEC ) NO 1586/OF THE COUNCIL OF AUGUST RELATING TO CERTAIN MEASURES OF CONJUNCTURAL POLICY TO BE TAKEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AS A RESULT OF THE DEVALUATION OF THE FRENCH FRANC ( OJ L P . ) AND FORMS PART OF A BODY OF PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO ADJUST THE FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERVENTION MECHANISMS OF THE COMMON ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETS TO THE DEVALUATION OF THE FRENCH FRANC ON AUGUST .  THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THESE MEASURES IS THAT CERTAIN CORRECTING FACTORS, CORRESPONDING TO THE DEVALUATION OF THE FRENCH FRANC AS AGAINST THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN AMOUNTS PAYABLE OR TO BE CHARGED BY FRANCE AS A RESULT OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY, AND THEY LAY DOWN THE AMOUNTS OF THESE IN FRENCH FRANCS FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS .  THE CONTESTED PROVISIONS ARE TRANSITIONAL MEASURES DESIGNED TO GOVERN THE EFFECTS OF THE ALTERATIONS OF THE AMOUNTS, EXPRESSED IN FRENCH FRANCS, WITH REGARD TO SITUATIONS WHICH AROSE UNDER THE PREVIOUS PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY .  THEY PROVIDE IN PARTICULAR THAT TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO EXPORTS WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF CONTRACTS OF SALE CONCLUDED IN FRENCH FRANCS BEFORE AUGUST SHALL NOT BE WHOLLY SUBJECT TO THE OBLIGATION TO PAY A COMPENSATORY AMOUNT PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN CASES WHERE A REFUND MAY BE FIXED IN ADVANCE THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS MADE USE OF .  IT IS ALSO PROVIDED THAT THE PROVISIONS IN QUESTION ARE TO TAKE EFFECT AS FROM AUGUST .  THE APPLICANT DENIES THAT THE CONTESTED PROVISIONS ARE GENERAL IN CHARACTER AND HAVE THE NATURE OF REGULATIONS, CLAIMING THAT THE RESTRICTION IMPOSED ON THE SCHEME PROVIDED FOR EXPORTS WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF CONTRACTS OF SALE CONCLUDED BEFORE AUGUST IN FRENCH FRANCS, AND THE CHOICE OF AUGUST AS THE DATE ON WHICH THE SCHEME SHOULD COME INTO EFFECT, ARE OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN TO HIM .  THE GROUP OF UNDERTAKINGS TO WHICH THE CONDITION OBJECTED TO APPLIES IS DEFINED, ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT, SINCE THE UNDERTAKINGS ARE ACCURATELY KNOWN OR IDENTIFIABLE FROM BEFORE THE DATE ON WHICH THE CONTESTED PROVISION WAS ADOPTED .  WHERE A MEASURE HAS THE CHARACTER OF A REGULATION THAT CHARACTER IS NOT CALLED IN ISSUE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE NUMBER AND EVEN THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM IT APPLIES AT A GIVEN MOMENT MAY BE DETERMINED MORE OR LESS PRECISELY, PROVIDED THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPLICATION DEPENDS ON AN OBJECTIVE LEGAL OR FACTUAL SITUATION DEFINED BY THE MEASURE WITH REFERENCE TO ITS PURPOSE .  THE FACT THAT A TRANSITIONAL PROVISION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS ARISING BEFORE A DATE FIXED BY IT AND, THEREFORE, OFTEN ESTABLISHED BEFORE IT COMES INTO FORCE, DOES NOT PREVENT THAT PROVISION FROM BEING AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FORMER AND NEW PROVISIONS WHICH IT IS DESIGNED TO RECONCILE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FROM PARTAKING OF THEIR GENERAL NATURE .  THERE IS ALSO NO DOUBT THAT ARTICLE OF REGULATION NO 1660/69, PROVIDING THAT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLES AND SHALL TAKE EFFECT FROM AUGUST 1969, HAS THE NATURE OF A REGULATION .  THE PROVISION IN QUESTION FIXES THE DATE FROM WHICH THE NEW PROVISIONS SHALL TAKE EFFECT .  IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY MISUSE OF POWERS, SUCH A PROVISION PARTAKES OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE MEASURES WHICH IT BRINGS INTO EFFECT .  IN ANY EVENT THE CHOICE OF AUGUST AS THE DATE WAS NECESSARY FROM AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, SINCE THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE INTERVENTION MECHANISMS OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY TO THE DEVALUATION OF THE FRENCH FRANC HAD TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE, THAT IS, FROM THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF REGULATION NO 1586/.  THERE IS THEREFORE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO INDICATE THAT ARTICLE WAS MERELY IN THE FORM OF A REGULATION AND CONCERNS THE APPLICANT INDIVIDUALLY .  THE RESULT OF THE FOREGOING IS THAT THE APPLICATION MUST BE DISMISSED AS INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
ACCORDING TO ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL PAY THE COSTS .  IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN ITS APPLICATION .  IT MUST THEREFORE BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  
Operative part
