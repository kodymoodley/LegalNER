Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE APPLICANT IN GRADE L/A 4, STEP 8, 
Grounds
P.ADMISSIBILITY  THE APPLICANT HAS REFERRED TO THE COURT THE COMMISSION'S FAILURE TO TAKE A DECISION WITH REGARD TO HIS REQUEST OR COMPLAINT OF OCTOBER 1964, RELATING TO THE CLASSIFICATION ACCORDED HIM BY THE DECISION OF SEPTEMBER .  ACCORDING TO THE DEFENDANT, THE APPLICATION IS REALLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE DECISION OF SEPTEMBER AND IS CONSEQUENTLY INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF TIME . UNDER ARTICLE 91() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS APPEALS TO THE COURT SHALL BE FILED WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION OF THE DISPUTED DECISION TO THE PERSON CONCERNED . A REQUEST OR COMPLAINT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED WITHIN THE SAID PERIOD CANNOT THEREFORE AVOID THE TIME-BAR RESULTING FROM THE EXPIRY OF THIS PERIOD . IN THE PRESENT CASE THE DECISION AS TO CLASSIFICATION OF SEPTEMBER WAS NOTIFIED TO THE APPLICANT ON SEPTEMBER AT THE LATEST . HIS REQUEST OR COMPLAINT OF OCTOBER WAS THUS SUBMITTED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS PRESCRIBED BY ARTICLE 91() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS .  THE APPLICANT MAINTAINS THAT HE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION NOT A COMPLAINT, BUT A REQUEST ' THE PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS THE RECOGNITION OF A RIGHT '. HE EMPHASIZES THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR SUCH A REQUEST TO BE SUBMITTED WITHIN A PRESCRIBED PERIOD .  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO INTO THE DISTINCTION WHICH THE APPLICANT MAKES BETWEEN THE TWO TERMS EMPLOYED BY ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS . IN FACT NEITHER A COMPLAINT NOR A REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THE PERSON SUBMITTING IT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING THE PERIOD FOR LODGING AN APPEAL TO START TO RUN AFRESH, WHEN SUCH A COMPLAINT OR REQUEST RELATES TO THE LEGALITY OF A MEASURE WHICH HE HAS REFRAINED FROM CONTESTING WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD .  THE NOTIFICATION TO THE APPLICANT THAT HIS REQUEST OR COMPLAINT WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION IS NOT OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO CAUSE THE PERIOD TO START TO RUN AFRESH UNDER ARTICLE . IN FACT SUCH AN INTERIM REPLY AMOUNTS TO A FAILURE TO GIVE A DECISION, WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE .  IT THEREFORE DOES NOT CAUSE THE TIME FOR BRINGING AN APPEAL TO THE COURT TO START TO RUN AFRESH .  THE APPLICANT RELIES ON THE NEW FACTOR CONSTITUTED, ACCORDING TO HIM, BY THE JUDGMENT OF JULY IN CASE 70/IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE COURT AND ONE OF ITS SERVANTS .  THIS JUDGMENT ANNULLED AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION CONCERNING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE SAID SERVANT .  THE ONLY PERSONS CONCERNED BY THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF A JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ANNULLING A MEASURE TAKEN BY AN INSTITUTION ARE THE PARTIES TO THE ACTION AND THOSE PERSONS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE MEASURE WHICH IS ANNULLED . SUCH A JUDGMENT CAN ONLY CONSTITUTE A NEW FACTOR AND CAUSE THE PERIODS FOR BRINGING APPEALS TO RUN AFRESH AS REGARDS THESE PARTIES AND PERSONS .  AS THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THIS INSTANCE, THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .  
Decision on costs
THE APPLICANT HAS FAILED IN HIS APPLICATION .  UNDER ARTICLE 69() OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS . HOWEVER, UNDER ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, IN PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED BY SERVANTS OF THE COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS SHALL BEAR THEIR OWN COSTS;  
Operative part
