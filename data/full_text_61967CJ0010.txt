Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 2() OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND OF THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY, 
Grounds
P.THE DEFENDANT HAS RAISED THE OBJECTION OF INADMISSIBILITY ON THE GROUND THAT THE APPLICATION WAS FILED AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PRESCRIBED TIME-LIMIT .  THE APPLICANT'S REQUEST FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 2() OF ANNEX VII TO THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS OF THE EEC WAS REFUSED BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF ADMINISTRATION, THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY IN THIS MATTER, BY A DECISION OF FEBRUARY AS SET OUT IN NOTES DATED APRIL AND JUNE .  THE PRESENT APPLICATION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE IMPLIED DECISION OF REFUSAL TO BE INFERRED FROM THE SILENCE OF THE COMMISSION AFTER RECEIVING THE APPLICANT'S COMPLAINT OF NOVEMBER WHEREBY HE REPEATED HIS REQUEST . THEREFORE THIS IMPLIED REFUSAL AMOUNTS TO A CONFIRMATION OF THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR - GENERAL OF ADMINISTRATION .  UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 91() OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS OF OFFICIALS APPEALS SHALL BE FILED WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION OF THE DECISION TO THE PERSON CONCERNED .  ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT A COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME, IT CAN ONLY EXTEND THE PERIOD ALLOWED UNDER ARTICLE 91() IF LODGED BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THAT PERIOD .  IN THIS CASE THE APPLICANT'S APPEAL TO THE COMMISSION THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS WAS MADE AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR APPEAL TO THE COURT AGAINST THE DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF ADMINISTRATION OF FEBRUARY 1966, WHICH IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS DISPUTE AND WHICH ALL THE SUBSEQUENT MEASURES HAVE MERELY CONFIRMED .  THE PRESENT APPLICATION IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE AS BEING OUT OF TIME .
