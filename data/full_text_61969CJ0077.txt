Subject of the case
APPLICATION FOR A DECLARATION THAT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY IN RESPECT OF THE FLAT-RATE TRANSFERENCE DUTY ON WOOD, 
Grounds
BY AN APPLICATION LODGED AT THE REGISTRY ON DECEMBER 1969, THE COMMISSION MADE AN APPLICATION TO THE COURT UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY FOR A DECLARATION " THAT THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM, BY APPLYING THE SAME RATE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE - OF THE GENERAL REGULATION ON DUTIES ASSIMILATED TO STAMP DUTIES ( ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH ) TO HOME-GROWN WOOD TRANSFERRED STANDING OR FELLED AND TO IMPORTED WOOD CALCULATED ON ITS VALUE AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF ENTRY FOR HOME USE, HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY ".  UNDER ARTICLE - OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH INTRODUCING THE GENERAL REGULATION ON DUTIES ASSIMILATED TO STAMP DUTIES AS AMENDED IN PARTICULAR BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER 1965, A SINGLE FLAT-RATE DUTY OF PER CENT IS LEVIED ON THE TRANSFER OF HOME-GROWN OR IMPORTED WOOD .  ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF TAX IS UNIFORM FOR ALL WOOD WHATEVER ITS ORIGIN, THE BASIS AND THE DETAILED METHODS OF LEVYING THE DUTY ARE DIFFERENT FOR HOME-GROWN WOOD AND FOR PRODUCTS COMING FROM ABROAD .  IN RESPECT OF THE FORMER, THE FLAT-RATE DUTY IS PAID, ACCORDING TO ARTICLE - ( ) ( ) AND ARTICLE - ( ) OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH 1927, AT THE TIME OF SALE BY THE PRODUCER OF WOOD TRANSFERRED STANDING OR FELLED .  ON THE OTHER HAND, IN RESPECT OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS, ASSESSMENT TAKES PLACE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH ( ) OF THE SAME ARTICLE, AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF ENTRY FOR HOME USE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MORE OR LESS ADVANCED STATE OF PROCESSING, DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH ( ) ( A ) TO ( J ).  ACCORDING TO THE WORDING OF PARAGRAPH ( ), " THE FLAT-RATE DUTY SHALL COVER ALL SUBSEQUENT TRANSFERS UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE GOODS IN THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER OR THE PERSON WHO SUBMITS THEM TO AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS ", IT BEING UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER THAT " PROCESSING OF ONE OF THE PRODUCTS ENUMERATED IN PARAGRAPH INTO ANOTHER OF THOSE PRODUCTS SHALL NOT BE REGARDED AS INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ".  IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS SYSTEM THAT, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE FLAT-RATE DUTY IS PAID AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER OF STANDING OR FELLED WOOD, HOME-GROWN WOOD IS EXEMPTED FROM ALL SUBSEQUENT CHARGES ARISING OUT OF THE INCREASE IN VALUE DUE TO THE PROCESSING DEFINED BY THE ROYAL DECREE .  THE SAME TREATMENT IS NOT EXTENDED TO IMPORTED WOOD WHICH, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SAME DECREE, IS TAXED IN RELATION TO ITS MORE ADVANCED STATE OF PROCESSING AND ASSESSED CONSEQUENTLY ON THE BASIS OF A HIGHER VALUE THAN THAT OF WOOD TRANSFERRED STANDING OR FELLED .  THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY ARTICLE - OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH THUS HAS, AS A RESULT OF THIS DIFFERENTIATION IN THE BASIS OF THE SINGLE FLAT-RATE DUTY, THE EFFECT OF TAXING IMPORTED WOOD, IF IT HAS ALREADY UNDERGONE PROCESSING, MORE HEAVILY THAN NATIONAL PRODUCTS IN A SIMILAR STAGE OF PROCESSING .  IT APPEARS CONSEQUENTLY THAT, ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF TAX IS APPARENTLY A UNIFORM ONE, THE SCHEME BROUGHT INTO FORCE BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH RESULTS IN DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN HOME-GROWN AND IMPORTED WOOD CONTRARY TO THE PROHIBITION OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT DISPUTE THE EXISTENCE OF DISCRIMINATION RESULTING FROM THE PROVISIONS WHICH FORM THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE PROCEEDINGS .  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF STEPS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION THE FIRST OF WHICH DATES BACK TO 1963, THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN ITS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES WITH A VIEW TO ELIMINATING THE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINED OF .  A DRAFT LAW INTENDED TO MAKE POSSIBLE A REVISION OF THE DISPUTED SCHEME WAS PUT BEFORE PARLIAMENT IN AND PROVISIONS WERE LATER ADOPTED IN ORDER TO REVIVE THIS DRAFT LAW WHICH HAD LAPSED OWING TO THE DISSOLUTION OF THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT IN THE MEANWHILE .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT THE DELAY IN ENACTING THE LAW AMOUNTS AS FAR AS IT IS CONCERNED TO A " CASE OF FORCE MAJEURE ".  THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM ARTICLE OF THE TREATY DEVOLVE UPON STATES AS SUCH AND THE LIABILITY OF A MEMBER STATE UNDER ARTICLE ARISES WHATEVER THE AGENCY OF THE STATE WHOSE ACTION OR INACTION IS THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS, EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CONSTITUTIONALLY INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION .  THE OBJECTION RAISED BY THE DEFENDANT CANNOT THEREFORE BE SUSTAINED .  IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, BY APPLYING A DUTY AT THE SAME RATE, AS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE - OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH AS AMENDED, TO HOME-GROWN WOOD TRANSFERRED STANDING OR FELLED AND TO IMPORTED WOOD CALCULATED ON ITS VALUE AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF ENTRY FOR HOME USE, THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE TREATY .  
Decision on costs
UNDER THE TERMS OF ARTICLE ( ) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE THE UNSUCCESSFUL PARTY SHALL BE ORDERED TO PAY THE COSTS .  THE DEFENDANT HAS FAILED IN ITS SUBMISSIONS .  
Operative part

DECLARES THAT, BY APPLYING A DUTY AT THE SAME RATE, AS LAID DOWN BY ARTICLE - OF THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH AS AMENDED BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF MARCH AS AMENDED BY THE ROYAL DECREE OF DECEMBER 1965, TO HOME-GROWN WOOD TRANSFERRED STANDING OR FELLED AND TO IMPORTED WOOD CALCULATED ON ITS VALUE AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF ENTRY FOR HOME USE, THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM HAS FAILED TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE OF THE EEC TREATY;  .
