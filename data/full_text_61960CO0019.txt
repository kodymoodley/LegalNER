WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF JUDGMENTS THE COURT MAY, OF ITS OWN MOTION OR ON APPLICATION BY A PARTY MADE WITHIN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE DELIVERY OF A JUDGMENT, RECTIFY CLERICAL MISTAKES, ERRORS IN CALCULATION AND OBVIOUS SLIPS IN IT .'  THIS PROVISION REFERS, AS A POSSIBLE GROUND FOR RECTIFICATION, TO PURELY MATERIAL ERRORS IN A JUDGMENT IN CASES WHERE NO DIFFICULTY ARISES CONCERNING THE MEANING OR SCOPE OF THE DECISION . RECTIFICATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE CANNOT PURPORT TO AMEND OR REVISE A PREVIOUS DECISION .

IT IS THEREFORE INADMISSIBLE .
